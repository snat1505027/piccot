{"question": "They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have 2 sets of tables, each having the same number of chairs. If there are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard. How many chairs are there for each table?", "qid": "862", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chairs for each table. We know that there are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard. Let's assume that the number of chairs for each table is x.\n\nWe can write the equation:\nx \\* 2 = 12\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\nx = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 chairs for each table.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/862.png"}
