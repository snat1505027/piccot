{"question": "Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 612 pages equally distributed over 24 chapters. It took Frank 6 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?", "qid": "474", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pages Frank read per day. We can start by finding the number of pages in each chapter. Since there are 24 chapters, we can divide 612 by 24 to get the average number of pages per chapter:\n\n612 \u00f7 24 = 25.5\n\nSince there are 24 chapters, we can round this number down to 25 pages per chapter. Now, we need to find the number of pages Frank read per day. We know that it took him 6 days to finish the book, so we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days:\n\n612 \u00f7 6 = 102\n\nThe answer is 102 pages per day.", "answer": 102.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/474.png"}
