{"question": "For Gwen's birthday she received some dollars. She spent 8 dollars and has 6 dollars left with her. How much money did Gwen receive for her birthday?", "qid": "653", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial amount of money Gwen received for her birthday. We know that she spent 8 dollars and has 6 dollars left with her. We can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\nMoney received - Money spent = Money left\n\nLet's call the initial amount of money Gwen received \"M.\" Since she spent 8 dollars, we can write:\n\nM - 8 = 6\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"M.\" To do this, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:\n\nM = 6 + 8\n\nM = 14\n\nThe answer is $14.", "answer": 14.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/653.png"}
