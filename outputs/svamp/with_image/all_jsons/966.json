{"question": "A mailman has to give 38 pieces of junk mail to each of the 78 blocks. If there are 19 houses on a block. How many pieces of junk mail should he give each house?", "qid": "966", "response": "First, we need to find out how many pieces of junk mail the mailman has to give to each block. We can do this by dividing the total number of pieces of junk mail (38) by the number of blocks (78).\n\n38 \u00f7 78 = 0.491\n\nSince the answer is not an integer, we need to round it up to the nearest whole number.\n\n0.491 rounded up to the nearest whole number is 1.\n\nSo, the mailman has to give 1 piece of junk mail to each block.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many houses on a block the mailman has to give the junk mail to. We know that there are 19 houses on a block.\n\nTo find out how many pieces of junk mail the mailman has to give to each house, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail (38) by the number of houses on a block (19).\n\n38 \u00f7 19 = 2.053\n\nSince the answer is not an integer, we need to round it down to the nearest whole number.\n\n2.053 rounded down to the nearest whole number is 2.\n\nSo, the mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each house.\n\nThe answer is 2 pieces of junk mail to each house.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/966.png"}
