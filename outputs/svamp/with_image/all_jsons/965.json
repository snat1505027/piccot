We can do this by subtracting the number of apples he had left from the total number of apples he had initially.\n\nThe chef had 40 apples and 54 peaches, so he had a total of 40 + 54 = 94 apples and peaches.\n\nAfter making the pies, he had 39 apples left, which means he used 94 - 39 = 55 apples.\n\nThe answer is 55 apples.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/965.png"}
