{"question": "5 red peaches, 14 yellow peaches and 6 green peaches are in the basket. How many green and yellow peaches are in the basket?", "qid": "56", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of peaches and then subtract the number of red peaches from it. We can then divide the result by 2 to find the number of green and yellow peaches.\n\nThere are 5 red peaches, 14 yellow peaches, and 6 green peaches in the basket. The total number of peaches is 5 + 14 + 6 = 25.\n\nTo find the number of green and yellow peaches, we need to divide the total number of peaches by 2. 25 \u00f7 2 = 12.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a peach, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. There are 12 green and yellow peaches in the basket.\n\nThe answer is 12.", "answer": 20.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/56.png"}
