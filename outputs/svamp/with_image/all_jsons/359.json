{"question": "Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. How many more peaches does Steven have than Jill?", "qid": "359", "response": "First, we need to find the number of peaches Jill has. Since Steven has 16 peaches and Jake has 9 fewer, we can find the number of peaches Jake has by subtracting 9 from 16:\n\n16 - 9 = 7\n\nNow, we know that Jake has 7 peaches. Since Steven has 16 peaches and Jake has 7 peaches, we can find the difference between the two:\n\n16 - 7 = 9\n\nThis means Steven has 9 more peaches than Jake. Since Jill has 18 more peaches than Jake, we can find the number of peaches Jill has by adding 18 to 9:\n\n9 + 18 = 27\n\nThe answer is 27.", "answer": 27.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/359.png"}
