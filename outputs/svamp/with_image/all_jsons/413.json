{"question": "Josh had 4 marbles in his collection. He lost 16 marbles and found 8 new ones. How many more marbles did he lose than those he found?", "qid": "413", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of marbles Josh had after losing 16 and finding 8 new ones. We can do this by adding the number of marbles he lost and the number of new marbles he found.\n\n4 (initial marbles) + 16 (marbles lost) + 8 (new marbles) = 28 marbles\n\nNow, we need to find the number of marbles Josh lost compared to the number of new marbles he found. To do this, we can subtract the number of new marbles from the total number of marbles.\n\n28 (total marbles) - 8 (new marbles) = 20 marbles\n\nThe answer is 20 marbles.", "answer": 8.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/413.png"}
