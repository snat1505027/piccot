{"question": "The Razorback shop makes $ 210 dollars off each jersey and $ 240 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?", "qid": "664", "response": "To find the difference in cost between a t-shirt and a jersey, we need to subtract the cost of a jersey from the cost of a t-shirt.\n\n1. First, we need to find the total cost of the t-shirts sold. We can do this by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold (177) by the cost per t-shirt ($210).\n\n177 t-shirts \\* $210 = $37,470\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total cost of the jerseys sold. We can do this by multiplying the number of jerseys sold (23) by the cost per jersey ($240).\n\n23 jerseys \\* $240 = $5,520\n\n3. Now, we can subtract the cost of the jerseys from the cost of the t-shirts to find the difference in cost.\n\n$37,470 - $5,520 = $31,950\n\nThe answer is $31,950.", "answer": 30.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/664.png"}
