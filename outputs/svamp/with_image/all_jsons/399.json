The machine made 4 shirts yesterday, which is 4/60 of an hour.\n2. The machine made 8 shirts today, which is 8/60 of an hour.\n3. The total number of shirts made is 4 + 8 = 12.\n4. The total time the machine worked is 4/60 + 8/60 = 12/60 of an hour.\n5. To convert the time to minutes, we multiply by 60: 12/60 \\* 60 = 72 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 72 minutes.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/399.png"}
