{"question": "6 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them.

So, the total number of birds is 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of storks that joined the birds. We have 8 more storks joining the birds. So, the total number of storks is 8.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of birds and storks on the fence. The total number of birds is 10, and the total number of storks is 8. So, the total number of birds and storks on the fence is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe answer is 18.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/14.png"}
