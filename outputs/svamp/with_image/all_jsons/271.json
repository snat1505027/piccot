{"question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 45 seeds in 9 flowerbeds. If they put same number of seeds in each flower bed. How many seeds did they plant in each flowerbed?", "qid": "271", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of seeds they planted in each flowerbed. We know that they planted 45 seeds in total and divided them among 9 flowerbeds.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of seeds per flowerbed. To do this, we can divide the total number of seeds by the number of flowerbeds:\n\n45 seeds \u00f7 9 flowerbeds = 5 seeds per flowerbed\n\nNow that we have the average number of seeds per flowerbed, we can find the number of seeds they planted in each flowerbed. Since the average is 5 seeds per flowerbed, we can multiply the number of seeds by 5 to get the number of seeds in each flowerbed:\n\n5 seeds per flowerbed \u00d7 9 flowerbeds = 45 seeds\n\nThe answer is 5 seeds per flowerbed.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/271.png"}
