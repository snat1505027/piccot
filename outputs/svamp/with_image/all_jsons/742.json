{"question": "Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. Thereafter 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?", "qid": "742", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of apples on the tree. Let's start by using the information provided in the image:\n\n1. Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree.\n2. 2 new apples grew on the tree.\n3. The tree now has 6 apples still on it.\n\nWe can use the following equation to represent the situation:\n\nInitial apples + Apples picked + Apples grown = Apples still on the tree\n\nLet's substitute the values:\n\n(Initial apples) + 7 + 2 = 6\n\nNow, we need to solve for the initial number of apples on the tree. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Subtract 7 and 2 from 6:\n6 - 7 - 2 = -3\n2. Add 3 to both sides of the equation to make it positive:\n6 - 7 - 2 + 3 = 3\n3. Divide both sides by 3 to find the initial number of apples:\n(6 - 7 - 2 + 3) / 3 = 1\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 11.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/742.png"}
