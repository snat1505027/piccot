{"question": "There were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?", "qid": "893", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of roses that were cut. Let's start by using the information given in the image:\n\n1. There were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase initially.\n2. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.\n3. There are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase.\n\nWe can represent the initial state of the vase with the following equation:\n\n13R + 84O = 100 (total number of flowers)\n\nSince Jessica cut some roses and orchids, we can represent the new state of the vase with the following equation:\n\n91O + 14R = 100 (total number of flowers)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of roses that were cut. To do this, we can subtract the number of roses in the new state (14) from the initial number of roses (13).\n\n13R - 14R = -1\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of roses, we can conclude that Jessica did not cut any roses. The answer is 0.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/893.png"}
