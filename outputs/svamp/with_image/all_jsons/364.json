How many unripe apples does the tree have now?", "qid": "364", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of unripe apples on the tree. First, we need to find the total number of apples on the tree. Rachel picked 7 ripe apples, so there are 5 apples left on the tree. Next, we need to find the number of ripe apples on the tree. There are 3 ripe apples on the tree. Finally, we can find the number of unripe apples on the tree by subtracting the number of ripe apples from the total number of apples.\n\n5 apples - 3 ripe apples = 2 unripe apples\n\nThe answer is 2 unripe apples.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/364.png"}
