{"question": "Lewis earns a total of $ 1216 during the harvest. If he earns $ 16 each week. How many weeks did the harvest last?", "qid": "936", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of weeks that Lewis worked during the harvest. We know that he earned $1216 in total and $16 per week. We can set up the equation:\n\n1216 / 16 = x\n\nNow, we need to solve for x, which represents the number of weeks. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 16:\n\nx = 1216 / 16\n\nx = 76\n\nThe answer is 76.", "answer": 76.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/936.png"}
