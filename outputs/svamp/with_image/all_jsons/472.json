{"question": "Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 5. Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs. How many groups will be created?", "qid": "472", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of groups of 5 that can be created using the given number of marbles and eggs.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of marbles and eggs. The total number of marbles is 10, and the total number of eggs is 15.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of groups of 5 that can be created using the total number of marbles and eggs. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of groups = (total number of marbles + total number of eggs - 1) / (total number of marbles + total number of eggs)\n\nIn this case, the formula would be:\n\nNumber of groups = (10 + 15 - 1) / (10 + 15)\n\nSimplifying the formula, we get:\n\nNumber of groups = 24 / 26\n\nNumber of groups = 24 / 26\n\nNumber of groups = 0.92304348\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round the number of groups to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/472.png"}
