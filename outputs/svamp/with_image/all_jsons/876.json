{"question": "Rebecca wants to split a collection of marbles into groups of 4. Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 marbles. How many groups will be created?", "qid": "876", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of groups that can be created by dividing the total number of marbles by the number of marbles in each group.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of marbles in each group. We can do this by dividing the total number of marbles by the desired number of marbles in each group. In this case, we want to divide the total number of marbles by 4.\n\n10 eggs + 20 marbles = 30 marbles\n30 marbles \u00f7 4 = 7.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n7.5 rounded up to the nearest whole number is 8.\n\nNow that we know the number of marbles in each group, we can find the number of groups. We can do this by dividing the total number of marbles by the number of marbles in each group.\n\n30 marbles \u00f7 8 marbles per group = 3.75\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n3.75 rounded up to the nearest whole number is 4.\n\nThe answer is 4 groups.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/876.png"}
