{"question": "Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did danny have at first?", "qid": "692", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of wrappers Danny had. We know that he found 66 wrappers at the park and now has 68 wrappers in his collection. This means that he gained 2 wrappers.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent this information:\n68 wrappers (now) - 2 wrappers = 66 wrappers (found)\n\nSolving the equation, we get:\n68 - 2 = 66\n\nThe answer is 66.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/692.png"}
