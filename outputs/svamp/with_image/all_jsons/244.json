{"question": "Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?", "qid": "244", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so we can write:\n\nEd = 19 + Doug\n\nEd lost some of his marbles at the playground, so we can write:\n\nEd = 19 + Doug - x\n\nNow, we know that Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, so we can write:\n\n19 + Doug - x = 8 + Doug\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n19 + Doug - x = 8 + 19\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n38 - x = 37\n\nSubtracting 37 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 1\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 11.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/244.png"}
