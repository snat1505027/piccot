{"question": "A farmer had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. If he picked 137 tomatoes. How many tomatoes are left?", "qid": "873", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tomatoes the farmer had and the number of tomatoes he picked. We can then subtract the number of tomatoes he picked from the total to find the number of tomatoes left.\n\n1. The farmer had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes, so he had a total of 105 + 71 = 176 tomatoes.\n2. The farmer picked 137 tomatoes, so he picked 137 from the total of 176 tomatoes.\n3. To find the number of tomatoes left, we subtract the number of tomatoes picked from the total: 176 - 137 = 39 tomatoes left.\n\nThe answer is 39.", "answer": 39.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/873.png"}
