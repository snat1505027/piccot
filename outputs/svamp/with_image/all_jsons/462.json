{"question": "There were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?", "qid": "462", "response": "First, we need to find the number of roses that were thrown away. We know that 15 roses were initially in the vase, and 33 roses were thrown away. So, the number of roses thrown away is 33.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of new roses cut from the garden. We know that there are now 17 roses in the vase, and we need to find out how many more roses were cut. To do this, we can subtract the initial number of roses (15) from the current number of roses (17).\n\n17 - 15 = 2\n\nSo, Jessica cut 2 more roses than the ones she threw away.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/462.png"}
