{"question": "Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together their strawberries weighed 4 pounds. Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds. How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?", "qid": "153", "response": "First, we need to find the total weight of strawberries that Marco and his dad picked together. We can do this by adding the weight of Marco's strawberries and his dad's strawberries.\n\n19 pounds (Marco's strawberries) + 4 pounds (his dad's strawberries) = 23 pounds (total weight)\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of Marco's strawberries more than his dad's strawberries. We can do this by subtracting the weight of his dad's strawberries from the total weight.\n\n23 pounds (total weight) - 4 pounds (his dad's strawberries) = 19 pounds (Marco's strawberries more than his dad's)\n\nThe answer is 19 pounds.", "answer": 34.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/153.png"}
