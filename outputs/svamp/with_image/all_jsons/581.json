The first equation states that Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese. The second equation states that he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese.\n\nTo find the answer, we need to find the time spent on learning English. We can do this by adding the time spent on learning Chinese to the time spent on learning English. The equation for this is:\n\nTime spent on learning English = Time spent on learning Chinese + 2 hours\n\nSince the time spent on learning Chinese is 5 hours, we can substitute this value in the equation:\n\nTime spent on learning English = 5 hours + 2 hours\n\nTime spent on learning English = 7 hours\n\nThe answer is 7 hours.", "answer": 7.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/581.png"}
