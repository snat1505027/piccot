{"question": "They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have some sets of tables, each having the 3 chairs. If there are a total of 9 chairs in the backyard. How many sets of tables do they have?", "qid": "526", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sets of tables that can accommodate 9 chairs. We know that each set of tables has 3 chairs.\n\nLet's start by dividing 9 by 3, which gives us 3. This means that they have 3 sets of tables.\n\nHowever, there are still 6 chairs left over, which means they have more sets of tables than the number of chairs that can be accommodated.\n\nTo find the total number of sets of tables, we need to add 3 to the number of sets of tables we initially found, which is 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThe answer is 6 sets of tables.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/526.png"}
