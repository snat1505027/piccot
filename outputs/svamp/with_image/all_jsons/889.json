{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet. How deep was the water?", "qid": "889", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the depth of the water. We know that the depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. We also know that Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron.\n\nFirst, we need to find the height of Dean. We can do this by adding 9 feet to Ron's height:\nDean's height = Ron's height + 9 feet\nDean's height = 13 feet + 9 feet\nDean's height = 22 feet\n\nNow that we have Dean's height, we can find the depth of the water. We know that the depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height, so we can calculate it by multiplying 16 by Ron's height:\nDepth of water = 16 x Ron's height\nDepth of water = 16 x 13 feet\nDepth of water = 208 feet\n\nThe answer is 208 feet.", "answer": 208.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/889.png"}
