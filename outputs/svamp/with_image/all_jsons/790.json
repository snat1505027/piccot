{"question": "Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches in gym class today. David did 38 more push-ups but 62 less crunches than zachary. How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?", "qid": "790", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of push-ups Zachary did. We know that Zachary did 46 push-ups and David did 38 more push-ups, so Zachary did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of crunches Zachary did. We know that Zachary did 58 crunches and David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so Zachary did 58 - 62 = 6 crunches.\n\nNow we can find the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did. The difference is 84 push-ups - 6 crunches = 78 push-ups.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of more crunches than push-ups Zachary did by dividing the number of crunches by the number of push-ups. 6 crunches \u00f7 78 push-ups = 0.076923077 (rounded to 3 decimal places).\n\nThe answer is Zachary did 0.076923077 more crunches than push-ups.", "answer": 12.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/790.png"}
