{"question": "The cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. If they are travelling at speed of 17. How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?", "qid": "643", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the distance from the current depth (849 feet) to the end of the cave. We can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nSince we know the speed (17) and the current depth, we can find the time required to reach the end of the cave. We can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the remaining depth: 1218 - 849 = 369 feet\n2. Convert the remaining depth from feet to meters: 369 feet \u2248 112.5 meters\n3. Calculate the time required to travel the remaining distance at a speed of 17:\ntime = distance / speed\ntime = 112.5 meters / 17\ntime \u2248 6.58 seconds\n\nThe answer is 6.58 seconds.", "answer": 369.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/643.png"}
