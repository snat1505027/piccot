{"question": "They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs. If there are 11 people sitting on chairs. How many chairs are left unoccupied?", "qid": "928", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of chairs and subtract the number of occupied chairs from it.\n\nThere are 10 sets of tables, and each set has 6 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 10 sets x 6 chairs per set = 60 chairs.\n\nThere are 11 people sitting on chairs, so the number of occupied chairs is 11 people x 1 chair per person = 11 chairs.\n\nTo find the number of chairs left unoccupied, we need to subtract the number of occupied chairs from the total number of chairs: 60 chairs - 11 chairs = 49 chairs left unoccupied.\n\nThe answer is 49 chairs left unoccupied.", "answer": 49.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/928.png"}
