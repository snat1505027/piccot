{"question": "Jessie weighed 114 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 50 kilograms in the first week and 60 kilograms in the second week. How much does she weigh now?", "qid": "517", "response": "First, we need to find the weight lost in the first week. We know that she lost 50 kilograms in the first week.\n\nNext, we need to find the weight lost in the second week. We know that she lost 60 kilograms in the second week.\n\nNow, we need to find the total weight lost. We add the weight lost in the first week and the weight lost in the second week.\n\nThe total weight lost is 50 kilograms + 60 kilograms = 110 kilograms.\n\nFinally, we need to find Jessie's current weight. We subtract the total weight lost from her initial weight.\n\nJessie's current weight is 114 kilograms - 110 kilograms = 4 kilograms.\n\nThe answer is 4 kilograms.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/517.png"}
