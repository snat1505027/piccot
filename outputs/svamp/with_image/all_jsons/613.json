{"question": "He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71 of them. How many sacks of oranges will they have after 51 days of harvest?", "qid": "613", "response": "First, we need to find the number of sacks of oranges that are not discarded. This is the number of sacks harvested per day minus the number of sacks discarded per day.\n\n74 sacks harvested per day - 71 sacks discarded per day = 3 sacks of oranges not discarded per day\n\nNext, we need to find the number of sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest. To do this, we multiply the number of sacks not discarded per day by the number of days.\n\n3 sacks of oranges not discarded per day \\* 51 days = 153 sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest\n\nThe answer is 153 sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest.", "answer": 153.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/613.png"}
