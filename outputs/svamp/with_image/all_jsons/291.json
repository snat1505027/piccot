Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill.\n\nWe can represent this information in a table:\n\n|  | Jake | Steven | Jill |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Peaches | 18 | 19 | 13 |\n\nNow, we need to find the number of peaches Jill has. To do this, we can use the fact that Steven has 19 peaches and Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven.\n\n19 (Steven's peaches) - 18 (Jake's peaches) = 1 (Jill's peaches)\n\nSo, Jill has 1 peach.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/291.png"}
