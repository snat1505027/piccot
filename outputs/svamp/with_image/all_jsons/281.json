{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 72 classrooms. There are 3 seats on each school bus. If there are a total of 111 students in the school. How many buses are needed to take the trip?", "qid": "281", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of buses needed to transport the students. We can start by dividing the total number of students by the number of seats per bus.\n\n111 students \u00f7 3 seats per bus = 37 buses needed\n\nHowever, we know that the school has 72 classrooms, and we need to account for that as well. We can do this by dividing the number of buses needed by the number of classrooms.\n\n37 buses \u00f7 72 classrooms = 0.52 buses per classroom\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of buses.\n\n0.52 buses per classroom rounded up to the nearest whole number = 1 bus per classroom\n\nTherefore, the school needs 72 buses to take the field trip.\n\nThe answer is 72.", "answer": 37.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/281.png"}
