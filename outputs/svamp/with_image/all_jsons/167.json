{"question": "An industrial machine can make 3 shirts per minute. It made 6 shirts in all. How many minutes was the machine working?", "qid": "167", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of minutes the machine worked. We know that the machine can make 3 shirts per minute, and it made 6 shirts in total. We can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the number of shirts made and the time it took to make them.\n\nLet's call the total number of minutes the machine worked \"x\". We can set up the proportion as follows:\n\n6 shirts / x minutes = 3 shirts / minute\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply to solve for \"x\":\n\n6 \\* 1 = 3 \\* x\n\nx = 6 / 3\n\nx = 2 minutes\n\nThe machine worked for 2 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 2 minutes.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/167.png"}
