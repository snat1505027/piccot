{"question": "We ordered 17 pizzas. Each pizza has 4 slices. If there are 25 of us. How many slices of pizza are there altogether?", "qid": "212", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of slices of pizza. We know that we ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. We also know that there are 25 of us.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of slices of pizza. We can do this by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:\n\n17 pizzas \\* 4 slices per pizza = 68 slices of pizza\n\nNext, we need to find out how many slices each person will get. To do this, we can divide the total number of slices by the number of people:\n\n68 slices of pizza / 25 people = 2.72 slices of pizza per person\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a slice, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we will round up to 3 slices of pizza per person.\n\nThe answer is: There are 2.72 slices of pizza per person, rounded up to 3 slices per person.", "answer": 68.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/212.png"}
