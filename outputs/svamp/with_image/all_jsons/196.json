{"question": "Jake has 8 fewer peaches and 10 more apples than Steven. Steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches. How many more peaches than apples does Steven have?", "qid": "196", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of apples and peaches Steven has. Steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches, so he has a total of 11 + 18 = 29 fruits.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of apples and peaches Jake has. Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so he has 11 + 10 = 21 apples. Jake also has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.\n\nNow, we can find the difference in the number of apples and peaches between Steven and Jake. Steven has 29 fruits (11 apples and 18 peaches), while Jake has 21 apples and 10 peaches, making a total of 21 + 10 = 31 fruits. The difference in the number of apples is 11 - 21 = -10, which means Steven has 10 more apples than Jake. The difference in the number of peaches is 18 - 10 = 8, which means Steven has 8 more peaches than Jake.\n\nThe answer is Steven has 8 more peaches than apples.", "answer": 7.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/196.png"}
