{"question": "In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys. How many boys are there in that school?", "qid": "16", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boys in the school. We know that there are 697 girls and 228 more girls than boys. So, we can start by finding the total number of students in the school.\n\n697 girls + 228 more girls = 925 girls\n\nNow, we need to find the number of boys in the school. Since there are 925 girls, and 228 more girls than boys, we can subtract 228 from 925 to find the number of boys.\n\n925 girls - 228 = 697 boys\n\nThe answer is 697 boys.", "answer": 469.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/16.png"}
