{"question": "Paul got a box of 601 crayons and 406 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 336 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more erasers than crayons did he have left?", "qid": "383", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of crayons and erasers Paul had at the beginning and the number of crayons he had left.\n\nAt the beginning, Paul had 601 crayons and 406 erasers, making a total of 601 + 406 = 1007.\n\nAt the end of the school year, Paul had 336 crayons left, which means he had 601 - 336 = 265 crayons left.\n\nTo find the difference between the number of erasers and crayons, we need to subtract the number of crayons Paul had left from the total number of crayons and erasers he had at the beginning: 406 - 265 = 141.\n\nSo, Paul had 141 more erasers than crayons left.\n\nThe answer is 141.", "answer": 70.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/383.png"}
