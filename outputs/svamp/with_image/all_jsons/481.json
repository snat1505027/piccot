{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height. Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron. If Ron stands at 12 feet. How deep was the water?", "qid": "481", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the depth of the water. We know that Ron's height is 12 feet, and Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron. We can use this information to find the depth of the water.\n\nFirst, we need to find the height of Dean. We can do this by subtracting 11 feet from Ron's height:\nDean's height = Ron's height - 11 feet = 12 feet - 11 feet = 1 foot\n\nNext, we know that the depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height. We can find the depth of the water by multiplying Ron's height by 5:\nDepth of water = 5 x Ron's height = 5 x 12 feet = 60 feet\n\nThe answer is 60 feet.", "answer": 60.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/481.png"}
