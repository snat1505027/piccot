{"question": "David did 40 more push-ups but 17 less crunches than Zachary in gym class today. If Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches. How many crunches did David do?", "qid": "701", "response": "Let's start by finding the number of push-ups David did. We know that David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 40 to Zachary's push-ups. Zachary did 34 push-ups, so David did 34 + 40 = 74 push-ups.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of crunches Zachary did and the number of crunches David did. We know that David did 17 less crunches than Zachary. Since Zachary did 62 crunches, we can subtract 17 from 62 to find the number of crunches David did. 62 - 17 = 45 crunches.\n\nThe answer is 74 push-ups and 45 crunches.", "answer": 45.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/701.png"}
