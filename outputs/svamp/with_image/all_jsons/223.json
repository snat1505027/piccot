{"question": "We ordered some pizzas. Each pizza has 2 slices. If there were a total of 28 slices. How many pizzas did we order?", "qid": "223", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pizzas ordered. We know that each pizza has 2 slices, and there are a total of 28 slices. We can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the number of pizzas and the total number of slices.\n\nLet's call the number of pizzas \"x\". We can write the proportion as:\n\nx / 28 = 2 / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the proportion by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx = 28 / 2\n\nx = 14\n\nSo, we ordered 14 pizzas.\n\nThe answer is 14.", "answer": 14.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/223.png"}
