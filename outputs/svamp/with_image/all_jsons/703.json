How many books did he buy?", "qid": "703", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of books Paul bought. Let's start by using the information we have:\n\n1. Paul had 50 books initially.\n2. After buying some books in a garage sale, he had 151 books left.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\n50 - x = 151\n\nNow, we need to solve for x, which represents the number of books Paul bought. To do this, we can add x to both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 50 + 151\n\nx = 201\n\nThe answer is 201.", "answer": 101.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/703.png"}
