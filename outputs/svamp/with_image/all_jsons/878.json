We can do this by multiplying the number of minutes it worked today (12) by the number of shirts it can make per minute (6).\n\n12 minutes \\* 6 shirts/minute = 72 shirts\n\nNow, we need to add the number of shirts made yesterday (30) to the number of shirts made today (72) to find the total number of shirts made.\n\n30 shirts + 72 shirts = 102 shirts\n\nThe answer is 102 shirts.", "answer": 72.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/878.png"}
