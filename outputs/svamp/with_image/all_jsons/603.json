{"question": "Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces of candy. Then he ate 5 more. If he still has 8 pieces of candy left. How many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start?", "qid": "603", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces of candy Bobby had at the start. Let's start by using the information we have:\n\n1. Bobby had 22 pieces of candy at the start.\n2. He ate some pieces of candy, and now he has 8 pieces left.\n3. He ate 5 more pieces of candy.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\n22 - x - 5 = 8\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\n22 - x = 8 + 5\n22 - x = 13\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 22 to find x:\n\nx = 22 - 13\nx = 9\n\nSo, Bobby had 9 pieces of candy at the start.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/603.png"}
