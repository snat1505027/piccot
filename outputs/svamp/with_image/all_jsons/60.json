{"question": "A waiter had 12 customers. While 15 customers left he got 14 new customers. How many customers does he still have?", "qid": "60", "response": "The waiter had 12 customers initially. When 15 customers left, he was left with 12 - 15 = -3 customers. Since it is not possible to have a negative number of customers, we can assume that the number of customers remains the same.\n\nThen, the waiter got 14 new customers, so he now has 12 + 14 = 26 customers.\n\nThe answer is 26.", "answer": 11.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/60.png"}
