{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She already put in 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?", "qid": "257", "response": "The image shows a table with the following information:\n\n1. Total cups of sugar: 10\n2. Cups of sugar already added: 10\n3. More cups of sugar needed: 12\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the difference between the total cups of sugar and the cups of sugar already added. We can then add the result to the cups of sugar already added to find the total cups of sugar needed.\n\nDifference = Total cups of sugar - Cups of sugar already added\nDifference = 10 - 10\nDifference = 0\n\nSince the difference is 0, it means that Mary has already added the correct amount of sugar. She does not need to add any more cups of sugar.\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/257.png"}
