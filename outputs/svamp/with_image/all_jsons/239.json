{"question": "Zachary did 51 push-ups in gym class today. David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 4 push-ups less than David. How many push-ups did John do?", "qid": "239", "response": "First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can calculate that by adding 22 to the number of push-ups Zachary did:\n\n51 (Zachary's push-ups) + 22 = 73 (David's push-ups)\n\nNext, we need to find out how many push-ups John did. We know that John did 4 push-ups less than David, so we can calculate that by subtracting 4 from the number of push-ups David did:\n\n73 (David's push-ups) - 4 = 69 (John's push-ups)\n\nThe answer is 69.", "answer": 69.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/239.png"}
