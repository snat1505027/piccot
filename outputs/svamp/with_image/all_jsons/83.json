{"question": "In a school there are 632 girls and 410 boys. 465 more girls joined the school. How many more girls than boys does the school have?", "qid": "83", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of girls and boys in the school after the girls joined.\n\n632 girls + 410 boys + 465 girls = 1407 girls and boys in total.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of girls and boys in the school before the girls joined.\n\n632 girls + 410 boys = 1042 girls and boys in total.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the two totals:\n\n1407 - 1042 = 365 girls and boys in total.\n\nSince there are 365 girls and boys in total, we can find the number of girls by dividing the total by the number of girls before the girls joined:\n\n365 / 1042 = 0.351 girls per boy.\n\nTo find the number of girls, we can multiply the number of boys by the number of girls per boy:\n\n410 boys x 0.351 girls per boy = 146.1 girls.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a girl, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n146.1 girls rounded up to the nearest whole number is 147 girls.\n\nNow, we can find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total:\n\n147 girls - 147 girls = 0 boys.\n\nSince there are 0 boys, the school has 147 girls more than boys.\n\nThe answer is 147 girls more than boys.", "answer": 687.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/83.png"}
