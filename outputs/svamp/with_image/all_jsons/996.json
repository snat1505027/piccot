{"question": "At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding. How many alligators were not hiding?", "qid": "996", "response": "In the image, there are two boxes with the number of snakes and alligators in each box. The first box has 3 snakes and 75 alligators, while the second box has 82 snakes and 19 alligators.\n\nTo find the number of alligators not hiding, we need to subtract the number of alligators hiding from the total number of alligators in the cage. In the first box, there are 75 alligators, and in the second box, there are 19 alligators. So, the total number of alligators in the cage is 75 + 19 = 94.\n\nSince there are 82 snakes hiding, we can conclude that the number of alligators not hiding is 94 - 82 = 12.\n\nThe answer is 12.", "answer": 56.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/996.png"}
