{"question": "Brenda's mother made cookies for 5. She prepared 22 cookies but had to throw away 17 cookies. If each of them had the same number of cookies. How many did each of them have?", "qid": "738", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of cookies that were prepared. We can do this by adding the number of cookies prepared and the number of cookies thrown away.\n\n22 cookies prepared + 17 cookies thrown away = 39 cookies in total\n\nNext, we need to find the number of cookies that were not thrown away. This is the total number of cookies minus the number of cookies thrown away.\n\n39 cookies - 17 cookies = 22 cookies\n\nNow, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of people to find the number of cookies each person had.\n\n22 cookies \u00f7 5 people = 4.4 cookies per person\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a cookie, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n4.4 cookies \u00f7 5 people = 0.88 cookies per person\n\nThe answer is 0.88 cookies per person.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/738.png"}
