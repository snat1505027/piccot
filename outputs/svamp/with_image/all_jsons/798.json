How many marbles does Doug have now?", "qid": "798", "response": "First, we need to find out how many marbles Doug had before he lost 7 of them. We can do this by adding 6 and 7 to get 13.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many marbles Ed had after Doug lost 7 of his marbles. We can do this by adding 7 to Ed's original 22 marbles to get 29.\n\nNow, we can find out how many marbles Doug has now by subtracting the number of marbles he lost from the number of marbles he had before he lost them.\n\nDoug had 13 marbles before he lost 7 of them, and he has 29 marbles now. Therefore, Doug has 29 - 13 = 16 marbles now.\n\nThe answer is 16.", "answer": 9.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/798.png"}
