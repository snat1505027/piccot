{"question": "There were 12 people on the bus. At the next stop 4 more people got on the bus. Each bus can not have more than 36 people. How many people are there on the bus now?", "qid": "834", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of people on the bus now. We can do this by adding the number of people who were on the bus initially (12) and the number of people who got on the bus at the next stop (4).\n\n12 + 4 = 16\n\nNext, we need to find out if the total number of people on the bus (16) is less than or equal to the maximum number of people the bus can hold (36). Since 16 is less than 36, we can conclude that the bus is not overcrowded.\n\nThe answer is 16.", "answer": 16.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/834.png"}
