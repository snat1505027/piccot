{"question": "Baker made 81 cakes. Then he made 92 more cakes. He sold 46 of them.

We can do this by adding the number of cakes he sold initially (46) and the number of cakes he sold after that (46).\n\n46 + 46 = 92\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the total number of cakes the baker made and the total number of cakes he sold.\n\n173 - 92 = 81\n\nThe answer is 81.", "answer": 127.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/979.png"}
