Lewis earns $21 per week.\n2. He has to pay $702 in tax.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season.\n\n1. We know that there are 216 weeks of harvest.\n2. We can calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season by multiplying the number of weeks by the amount he earns per week.\n\n216 weeks \\* $21/week = $<<216*21=45,280>>45,280\n\n1. We can calculate the total amount of money Lewis has to pay in tax by multiplying the amount he earns by the tax percentage.\n\n45,280 \\* 0.07 = $<<45,280*0.07=3,186.40>>3,186.40\n\n1. We can now find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season by subtracting the amount he has to pay in tax from the total amount he earns.\n\n45,280 - 3,186.40 = $<<45,280-3,186.40=42,093.60>>42,093.60\n\nThe answer is $42,093.60.", "answer": 3834.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/874.png"}
