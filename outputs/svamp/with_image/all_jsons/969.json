{"question": "Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 5 feet long. What is the width of her room?", "qid": "969", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the room. We know that the room is 5 feet long, and we need to find the width.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the room. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width. In this case, the length is 5 feet, and we need to find the width.\n\nThe area of the room is 5 feet x width = x.\n\nNext, we know that the carpet needs to cover the entire room, so the area of the carpet must be equal to the area of the room.\n\n5 feet x width = 10 square feet\n\nNow, we can solve for the width:\n\nwidth = 5 feet / 10 square feet\n\nwidth = 0.5 feet\n\nThe width of the room is 0.5 feet.\n\nThe answer is 0.5 feet.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/969.png"}
