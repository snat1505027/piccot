{"question": "A mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he gives 8 mails to each house in a block. How many houses are there in a block?", "qid": "734", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of houses in a block. We can do this by dividing the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of blocks.\n\n32 pieces of junk mail \u00f7 55 blocks = 0.58 houses per block\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a house, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n0.58 houses per block rounded up to the nearest whole number = 6 houses per block\n\nThe answer is 6 houses per block.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/734.png"}
