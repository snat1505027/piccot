{"question": "Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park. Now he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did danny have at first?", "qid": "18", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of wrappers Danny had. Let's start by using the information given in the image:\n\n1. Danny collected 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park.\n2. He now has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection.\n\nWe can use the information to create a simple equation:\n\n22 + 30 = x (initial number of wrappers)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps Danny currently has (17) from the total number of wrappers and bottle caps he collected (57):\n\n57 - 17 = 40\n\nSince we know that Danny collected 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers, we can deduce that he had 40 - 22 = 18 wrappers at first.\n\nThe answer is 18.", "answer": 27.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/18.png"}
