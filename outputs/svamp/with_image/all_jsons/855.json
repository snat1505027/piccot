{"question": "Jesse's room is 7 feet long. If she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet. What is the width of her room?", "qid": "855", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the width of Jesse's room. We know that the length of the room is 7 feet, and we need to find the width.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 7 feet is equal to 7 x 12 = 84 inches.\n\nNext, we need to find the width of the carpet. The carpet needs to be 14 square feet, so we can find the width by dividing 14 by the length (in inches).\n\n14 square feet / 7 feet = 2 square feet per foot\n\nNow, we can find the width of the room by multiplying the length (in inches) by the width per foot (2 square feet).\n\n84 inches x 2 square feet per foot = 168 square inches\n\nTo convert the answer from square inches to inches, we divide by the number of square inches in an inch (144).\n\n168 square inches / 144 square inches per inch = 1.17 inches\n\nThe width of Jesse's room is 1.17 inches.\n\nThe answer is 1.17 inches.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/855.png"}
