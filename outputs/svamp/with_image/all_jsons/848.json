{"question": "After a typhoon, 2 trees in Haley's backyard died. If she had grown 11 trees initially. How many more trees survived the typhoon than those that died?", "qid": "848", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of trees that survived the typhoon and the number of trees that died.\n\nFirst, we know that 2 trees died in the typhoon.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of trees that survived the typhoon. We can do this by subtracting the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees.\n\n11 trees initially - 2 trees died = 9 trees survived the typhoon.\n\nNow we need to find the difference between the number of trees that survived and the number of trees that died.\n\n9 trees survived the typhoon - 2 trees died = 7 trees more trees survived the typhoon than those that died.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/848.png"}
