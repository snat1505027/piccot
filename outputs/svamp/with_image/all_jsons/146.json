{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. If the depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height and he stands at 9 feet. How much deeper is the water than Dean's height?", "qid": "146", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the depth of the water in relation to Dean's height. We know that the depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height, and Dean's height is 9 feet.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the feet to meters. There are 0.3048 meters in a foot, so 9 feet is approximately 2.7432 meters.\n\nNext, we can find the depth of the water by multiplying Dean's height by 10:\n\nDepth of water = 2.7432 meters \\* 10 = 27.432 meters\n\nThe answer is 27.432 meters.", "answer": 81.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/146.png"}
