We know that the book has 2 chapters and the first chapter is 60 pages long. We also know that the total number of pages in the book is 93.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of pages in the second chapter. We can do this by subtracting the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages in the book:\n\n93 - 60 = <<93-60=33>>33\n\nSo, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.\n\nThe answer is 33.", "answer": 33.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/813.png"}
