How many crunches did David do?", "qid": "494", "response": "First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary. So, David did 44 + 29 = 73 push-ups.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many crunches Zachary did. We know that Zachary did 17 crunches and David did 13 less crunches than Zachary. So, Zachary did 17 - 13 = 4 crunches.\n\nFinally, we can find out how many crunches David did by subtracting the number of crunches Zachary did from the total number of crunches. David did 73 push-ups and 4 crunches, so he did a total of 73 + 4 = 77 crunches.\n\nThe answer is 77.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/494.png"}
