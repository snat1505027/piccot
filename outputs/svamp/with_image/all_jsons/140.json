{"question": "23 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 24 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 8 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?", "qid": "140", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and the number of children who got off the bus.\n\nFirst, we know that 23 children were riding on the bus. Then, 24 children got on the bus, and some got off the bus. So, the total number of children on the bus is 23 + 24 - some = 47 children.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of children who got off the bus. Since the total number of children on the bus is 47, and we know that some children got off, we can deduce that the number of children who got off is 47 - some.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and the number of children who got off the bus. The difference is 24 - (47 - some) = 24 - 47 + some = 24 - 47 + some = 24 - 47.\n\nThe answer is 24 - 47.", "answer": 15.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/140.png"}
