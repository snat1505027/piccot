{"question": "Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?", "qid": "754", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of crayons Paul received for his birthday. Let's call that number x.\n\nWe know that Paul lost or gave away 551 crayons, leaving him with 177. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx - 551 = 177\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 551 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 551 + 177\n\nx = 728\n\nSo, Paul received 728 crayons for his birthday.\n\nThe answer is 728.", "answer": 728.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/754.png"}
