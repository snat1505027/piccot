{"question": "Baker made 54 cakes. He sold some of them. If he still has 13 cakes left. How many cakes did baker sell?", "qid": "557", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. Baker made 54 cakes, and he still has 13 cakes left. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\n54 cakes made - x cakes sold = 13 cakes left\n\nNow we need to solve for x, which represents the number of cakes sold. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Add 13 to both sides of the equation to isolate x:\n\n54 cakes made - x cakes sold + 13 = 13 cakes left\n\n2. Simplify the equation:\n\n54 - x = 13\n\n3. Solve for x by subtracting 13 from 54:\n\nx = 54 - 13\n\nx = 41\n\nThe answer is 41.", "answer": 41.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/557.png"}
