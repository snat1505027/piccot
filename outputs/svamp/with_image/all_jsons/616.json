{"question": "Matthew gave 6 crackers to each his friends. If he had 36 crackers. How many friends did he give crackers to?", "qid": "616", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of friends Matthew gave crackers to. We know that he gave 6 crackers to each friend. Let's call the number of friends 'x'.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the information:\n6x = 36\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation to find the value of 'x'. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:\nx = 36 / 6\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 6:\nx = 6\n\nSo, Matthew gave crackers to 6 friends.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/616.png"}
