{"question": "Kelly has 46 nintendo games and 132 sony games. How many sony games does she need to give away so that she will have 31 sony games left?", "qid": "407", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sony games Kelly needs to give away to have 31 sony games left.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of sony games Kelly has. We know that she has 132 sony games.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of sony games she needs to give away from the total number of sony games she has. We are given that she needs to give away a certain number of sony games to have 31 sony games left.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n132 - x = 31\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 31 to both sides of the equation:\n132 + x = 31 + 31\n263 = 62\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 62 to find the value of x:\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, Kelly needs to give away 4 sony games to have 31 sony games left.\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 101.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/407.png"}
