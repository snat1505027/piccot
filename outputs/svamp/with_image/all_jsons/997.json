{"question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?", "qid": "997", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of flowers that grew in each flower bed. We know that 15 seeds were planted in each flower bed, and 60 seeds grew into flowers. To find the number of flowers, we can divide the number of seeds that grew into flowers by the number of seeds planted in each bed.\n\n15 seeds planted in each bed \u00d7 60 seeds grew into flowers = 900 seeds grew into flowers\n\nSince there are 60 seeds that grew into flowers, we can find the number of flowers by dividing the number of seeds that grew into flowers by the number of seeds planted in each bed.\n\n900 seeds grew into flowers \u00f7 15 seeds planted in each bed = 60 flowers\n\nThe answer is 60 flowers.", "answer": 220.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/997.png"}
