{"question": "Frank was reading through his favorite book. He read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. How many pages are there in the book?", "qid": "202", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pages in the book. We can use the information provided in the image to set up an equation.\n\nLet's assume the book has x pages. Since Frank read 22 pages per day, he read a total of 22x pages. It took him 569 days to finish the book, so we can write:\n\n22x = 569\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 22:\n\nx = 569 / 22\n\nx = 25\n\nSo, the book has 25 pages.\n\nThe answer is 25.", "answer": 12518.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/202.png"}
