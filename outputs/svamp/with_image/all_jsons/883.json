She collected 91 more dollars from the ATM, making a total of 53 + 91 = 144 dollars. After visiting the supermarket, there were 14 dollars left in her wallet.\n\nTo find out how much more money she spent at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM, we need to subtract the amount left in her wallet (14) from the total amount she had (144). The difference is 144 - 14 = 130.\n\nThe answer is 130.", "answer": 39.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/883.png"}
