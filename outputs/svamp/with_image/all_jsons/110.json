{"question": "You had 26 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total. How many cookies does each bag have?", "qid": "110", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cookies and candies and then divide it by the number of bags.\n\nThe image shows that there are 15 candies and 52 cookies in total. We can add these numbers to find the total: 15 + 52 = 67.\n\nNow, we need to divide the total number of cookies and candies by the number of bags to find the number of cookies per bag.\n\n67 \u00f7 26 = 2.58\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a cookie, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n2.58 \u2248 2\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/110.png"}
