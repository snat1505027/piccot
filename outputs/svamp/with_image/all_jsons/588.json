{"question": "Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he only had 291 crayons left since he had either lost or given away 315 of them. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?", "qid": "588", "response": "Paul got a box of crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year, he only had 291 crayons left since he had either lost or given away 315 of them.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of crayons Paul had at the beginning of the school year. We know that he had 291 crayons left, so we can set up the equation:\n\n291 - 315 = X (the number of crayons Paul had at the beginning of the school year)\n\nNow, we need to solve for X:\n\n291 - 315 = X\n315 = 291 + X\n\nNow, we can add 291 to both sides of the equation:\n\n315 + 291 = 291 + X\n506 = X\n\nThe answer is 506.", "answer": 606.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/588.png"}
