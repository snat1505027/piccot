{"question": "Edward spent $ 6 to buy 2 books each book costing him the same amount of money. Now he has $ 12. How much did each book cost?", "qid": "895", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each book. Let's start by using the information provided in the image. Edward spent $6 on buying the books, and he bought 2 books.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total cost of the books. We can do this by multiplying the number of books by their cost:\n\n2 books \\* cost of each book = total cost\n\nNext, we can set up an equation to represent the problem:\n\n2x = 6\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation to find the cost of each book. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx = 3\n\nFinally, we can find the cost of each book by multiplying the cost by the number of books:\n\ncost of each book = 3 \\* cost\n\nThe answer is $3.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/895.png"}
