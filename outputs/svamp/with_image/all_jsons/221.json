{"question": "The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 78 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 186 t-shirts. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the Texas tech game?", "qid": "221", "response": "To find the total money made during the Texas Tech game, we need to find the number of t-shirts sold during that game. We know that the total number of t-shirts sold during both games is 186. We also know that 172 t-shirts were sold during the Arkansas game. Therefore, the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game is 186 - 172 = 14.\n\nTo find the total money made during the Texas Tech game, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the amount of money made per t-shirt. We know that 14 t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game, and each t-shirt made $78. Therefore, the total money made during the Texas Tech game is 14 x $78 = $1,088.\n\nThe answer is $1,088.", "answer": 1092.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/221.png"}
