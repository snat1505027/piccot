How many push-ups did David do?", "qid": "460", "response": "First, we need to find out how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that Zachary did 19 push-ups.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. So, we can calculate the number of push-ups David did by adding 39 to the number of push-ups Zachary did:\n\n39 + 19 = 58\n\nSo, David did 58 push-ups.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many push-ups John did. We know that John did 13 push-ups less than David. So, we can calculate the number of push-ups John did by subtracting 13 from the number of push-ups David did:\n\n58 - 13 = 45\n\nSo, John did 45 push-ups.\n\nThe answer is 58.", "answer": 58.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/460.png"}
