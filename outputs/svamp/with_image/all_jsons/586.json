{"question": "21 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 10 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 16 children altogether on the bus. How many children got on the bus at the bus stop?", "qid": "586", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of children on the bus before and after the children got off and got on at the bus stop.\n\nFirst, we know that there were 21 children on the bus initially. Then, 10 children got off the bus, leaving 11 children on the bus. Next, some more children got on the bus, increasing the number of children on the bus to 16.\n\nTo find the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children on the bus after they got on.\n\n16 - 11 = 5\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/586.png"}
