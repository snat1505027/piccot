{"question": "Steven has 12 peaches. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven who has 67 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?", "qid": "176", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of peaches Jake has. Let's start by finding the number of peaches Steven has.\n\nSteven has 12 peaches, and Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven. So, Jake has 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 peaches.\n\nNow, Steven has 67 more peaches than Jake. So, Steven has 67 + 8 = <<67+8=75>>75 peaches.\n\nJill has 75 - 67 = <<75-67=8>>8 peaches.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/176.png"}
