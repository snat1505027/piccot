{"question": "There were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?", "qid": "939", "response": "First, we need to find the number of roses and orchids in the vase before Jessica cut more flowers. There were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase initially.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of roses and orchids after Jessica cut more flowers. There are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of roses and orchids before and after Jessica cut more flowers. The difference in roses is 12 - 5 = 7. The difference in orchids is 2 - 3 = -1.\n\nSince there are fewer orchids now than before, we need to find the number of roses that would make the total number of roses and orchids equal. To do this, we can add the number of orchids to the number of roses and then divide the result by 2. This will give us the number of roses that would make the total number of roses and orchids equal.\n\nThe number of roses that would make the total number of roses and orchids equal is (7 + 2) / 2 = 9.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 roses more than orchids in the vase now.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/939.png"}
