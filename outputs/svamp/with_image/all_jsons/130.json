After cutting, there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase.\n\nSo, the total number of roses and orchids in the vase is:\n\n7 roses + 12 orchids + 11 roses + 20 orchids = 40 roses and orchids in total.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of orchids more than roses in the vase.\n\nThere are 20 orchids in the vase, and we need to subtract the number of roses, which is 11.\n\n20 orchids - 11 roses = 9 more orchids than roses in the vase.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/130.png"}
