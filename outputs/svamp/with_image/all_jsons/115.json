{"question": "A farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden. If he picked 56 of them yesterday and 41 today. How many did he have left after yesterday's picking?", "qid": "115", "response": "First, we need to find out how many tomatoes the farmer had after picking 56 of them yesterday. To do this, we can use the equation:\n\n160 - 56 = <<160-56=104>>104 tomatoes left after yesterday's picking.\n\nThen, we need to find out how many tomatoes the farmer had after picking 41 of them today. To do this, we can use the equation:\n\n104 - 41 = <<104-41=63>>63 tomatoes left after today's picking.\n\nSo, the farmer had 63 tomatoes left after both yesterday's and today's picking.", "answer": 104.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/115.png"}
