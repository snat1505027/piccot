How many seats does the Ferris wheel have?", "qid": "940", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of seats on the Ferris wheel. We know that 18 people can ride the wheel at the same time, and each seat can hold 9 people. We can use the information provided in the image to set up a proportion equation.\n\nLet's call the number of seats 'x'. We can write the equation as:\n\nx / 9 = 18\n\nNow, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9:\n\nx = 18 \\* 9\n\nx = 162\n\nThe Ferris wheel has 162 seats.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/940.png"}
