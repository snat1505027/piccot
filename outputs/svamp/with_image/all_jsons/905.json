{"question": "Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide. If each tile is of size 4 square feet. How many tiles does she need to cover the whole floor?", "qid": "905", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the room first. The room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide, so the length is 2 feet and the width is 12 feet.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of each tile. The size of each tile is 4 square feet.\n\nNow, we can find the total area of the room by multiplying the length and width of the room. The area of the room is 2 feet x 12 feet = 24 square feet.\n\nTo cover the whole floor, we need to divide the total area of the room by the area of each tile. The number of tiles needed is 24 square feet \u00f7 4 square feet per tile = 6 tiles.\n\nThe answer is 6 tiles.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/905.png"}
