{"question": "Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?", "qid": "809", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so we can write:\n\nAdam has x apples\nJackie has x - 4 apples\n\nTogether, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write:\n\nx + (x - 4) = 14\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x - 4 = 14\n\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get:\n\n2x = 18\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 9\n\nNow we know that Adam has 9 apples. To find out how many apples Bob has, we need to add 6 apples to the total number of apples Adam and Jackie have together.\n\n9 + 6 = 15\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 20.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/809.png"}
