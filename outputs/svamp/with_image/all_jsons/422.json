{"question": "There are 3941 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4950 erasers. If the erasers are organized into 495 groups. How big is each group?", "qid": "422", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of skittles in each group. First, we need to find the total number of skittles in Steven's collection. We know that there are 3941 skittles in the collection.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of erasers in Steven's collection. We know that there are 4950 erasers.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of skittles in each group. To do this, we can divide the total number of skittles by the total number of groups.\n\n3941 skittles \u00f7 495 groups = 7.95 skittles per group\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a skittle, we need to round the number of skittles per group to the nearest whole number.\n\n7.95 skittles per group \u00f7 1 = 7 skittles per group\n\nThe answer is 7 skittles per group.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/422.png"}
