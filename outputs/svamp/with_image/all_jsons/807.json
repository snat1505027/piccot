{"question": "Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially. How many crackers did each person eat?", "qid": "807", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of crackers and cakes that Matthew gave to his friends. We can do this by adding the number of crackers and cakes he initially had.\n\n32 crackers + 98 cakes = 130 total items\n\nNext, we need to find the number of friends Matthew gave the items to. Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend, we can find the number of friends by dividing the total number of items by the number of items per friend.\n\n130 total items / 4 friends = 32.5 friends\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a friend, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of friends.\n\n32.5 friends \u2248 33 friends\n\nNow, we can find the number of crackers each person ate by dividing the total number of crackers by the number of friends.\n\n32 crackers / 33 friends = 0.97 crackers per friend\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a cracker, we need to round down to the nearest whole number of crackers per friend.\n\n0.97 crackers per friend \u2248 1 cracker per friend\n\nThe answer is 1 cracker per friend.", "answer": 8.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/807.png"}
