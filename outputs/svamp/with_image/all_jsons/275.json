Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, so she needs to add 7 cups of flour - 2 cups of flour = 5 cups of flour.\n\nTo find the difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of salt, we need to subtract the number of cups of salt (4 cups) from the number of cups of flour (5 cups).\n\n5 cups of flour - 4 cups of salt = 1 cup of flour.\n\nThe answer is 1 cup of flour.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/275.png"}
