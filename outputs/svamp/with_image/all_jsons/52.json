{"question": "Emily is making bead necklaces for her 43 friends. She had 20 beads and she was able to make 5 necklaces. How many beads did each necklace need?", "qid": "52", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many beads Emily needs for each necklace. We know that she had 20 beads and was able to make 5 necklaces.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many beads Emily used for each necklace. To do this, we can divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces she made:\n\n20 beads \u00f7 5 necklaces = 4 beads per necklace\n\nNow that we know each necklace needs 4 beads, we can find out how many beads Emily needs in total for all 43 friends. We can multiply the number of friends by the number of beads per necklace:\n\n43 friends \u00d7 4 beads per necklace = 172 beads\n\nThe answer is 172 beads.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/52.png"}
