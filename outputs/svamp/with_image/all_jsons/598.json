{"question": "Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 45 marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?", "qid": "598", "response": "First, we need to find out how many marbles Doug had initially. We know that Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up the equation:\n\nEd's marbles - Doug's marbles = 10\n\nNext, we need to find out how many marbles Doug had after losing 11 of them. We can set up another equation:\n\nDoug's marbles after losing 11 - Doug's marbles before losing 11 = 11\n\nNow we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:\n\n(Ed's marbles - Doug's marbles before losing 11) - (Doug's marbles after losing 11 - Doug's marbles before losing 11) = 10\n\nWe can simplify this equation by combining like terms:\n\nEd's marbles - Doug's marbles before losing 11 - (Doug's marbles after losing 11 - Doug's marbles before losing 11) = 10\n\nEd's marbles - Doug's marbles before losing 11 - Doug's marbles after losing 11 = 10\n\nWe know that Ed had 45 marbles, so we can substitute that value into the equation:\n\n45 - Doug's marbles before losing 11 - Doug's marbles after losing 11 = 10\n\nNow we can solve for Doug's marbles before losing 11:\n\n45 - Doug's marbles after losing 11 - Doug's marbles after losing 11 = 10\n\n2 \\* Doug's marbles after losing 11 = 45 + 10\n\nDoug's marbles after losing 11 = 55\n\nWe can now substitute this value into the original equation:\n\nEd's marbles - Doug's marbles = 10\n\nEd's marbles - 55 = 10\n\nEd's marbles = 65\n\nThe answer is Ed had 65 marbles after Doug lost 11 of his marbles.", "answer": 21.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/598.png"}
