{"question": "Nell collects baseball cards. She had 528 cards while Jeff had 11 cards. She gave some of her cards to jeff and now has 252 cards left. How many cards did Nell give to Jeff?", "qid": "917", "response": "Nell started with 528 cards and gave some to Jeff, so she had fewer cards left. We can represent this with the equation:\n\n528 - x = 252\n\nWe need to solve for x to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we can add x to both sides of the equation:\n\n528 + x = 252\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by subtracting 528 from both sides:\n\nx = 252 - 528\n\nx = -276\n\nHowever, this is not a valid solution since we cannot have a negative number of cards. This means that the equation is not balanced, and we need to reconsider the problem.\n\nThe answer is 11.", "answer": 276.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/917.png"}
