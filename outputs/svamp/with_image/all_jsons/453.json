{"question": "Jake has 3 fewer peaches and 4 more apples than Steven. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches. How many more apples than peaches does Steven have?", "qid": "453", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of apples and peaches that Steven has. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so the total is 19 + 15 = 34.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of apples and peaches that Jake has. Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, so he has 19 + 4 = 23 apples. Jake also has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of apples and peaches that Steven has and the number of apples and peaches that Jake has. The difference in apples is 19 - 23 = -4, and the difference in peaches is 15 - 12 = 3.\n\nSince Steven has more apples than peaches, the answer is that Steven has 3 more apples than peaches. The answer is 3.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/453.png"}
