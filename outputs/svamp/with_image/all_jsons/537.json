{"question": "Steven has 19 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and 72 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?", "qid": "537", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can start by subtracting 19 from 12.\n\n19 - 12 = 7\n\nNext, we know that Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill. To find the total number of peaches Jake has, we need to add 72 to the number of peaches Jill has.\n\n72 + 72 = 144\n\nThe answer is 144.", "answer": 7.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/537.png"}
