{"question": "Faye was placing her pencils into rows with 16 pencils in each row. She had 28 packs of pencils each one having 24 pencils. How many rows could she make?", "qid": "515", "response": "To find the number of rows, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row.\n\n28 packs of pencils with 24 pencils in each pack = 28 x 24 = 672 pencils\n\n672 pencils divided by 16 pencils in each row = 41.5 rows\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a row, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of rows.\n\n41.5 rows rounded up to the nearest whole number of rows = 42 rows\n\nThe answer is 42 rows.", "answer": 42.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/515.png"}
