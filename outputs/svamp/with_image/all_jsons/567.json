{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 13 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 12 more cups of flour. How many cups of flour did she put in?", "qid": "567", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cups of flour Mary has already added. We can do this by subtracting the number of cups of flour she still needs from the total number of cups of flour required in the recipe.\n\nThe recipe calls for 13 cups of flour, and she still needs 12 more cups of flour. So, we can write the equation:\n\n13 cups of flour - 12 cups of flour = x cups of flour\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1 cups of flour = x cups of flour\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 1:\n\nx = 1 cups of flour\n\nThe answer is 1 cup of flour.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/567.png"}
