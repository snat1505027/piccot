{"question": "Danny collects bottle caps. He found 63 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 51 old ones. Now he has 33 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?", "qid": "168", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of bottle caps Danny had. Let's call that number x.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Danny found 63 bottle caps at the park and threw away 51 old ones. So, he gained 63 - 51 = 12 bottle caps.\n\nWe also know that he now has 33 bottle caps in his collection. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 12 = 33\n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 33 - 12\n\nx = 21\n\nSo, Danny had 21 bottle caps at first.\n\nThe answer is 21.", "answer": 21.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/168.png"}
