{"question": "There were 21 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?", "qid": "844", "response": "First, we need to find the number of roses that were originally in the vase. We know that there were 21 roses in the vase, and Jessica threw away 34 roses. So, the total number of roses in the vase was 21 + 34 = 55 roses.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of roses that Jessica cut from her flower garden to put in the vase. We know that there are now 15 roses in the vase, so we can find the difference between the total number of roses and the current number of roses to get the number of roses cut from the garden. 55 - 15 = 40 roses.\n\nFinally, we can find the difference between the number of roses thrown away and the number of roses cut from the garden. 34 - 40 = -6 roses.\n\nThe answer is -6 roses.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/844.png"}
