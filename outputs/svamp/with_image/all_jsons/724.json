We know that each sack contains 25 oranges.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sacks are harvested per day. We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of oranges harvested per day by multiplying the number of sacks by the number of oranges per sack: 66 sacks x 25 oranges per sack = 1650 oranges harvested per day.\n\nTo find out the total number of oranges harvested after 87 days, we can multiply the number of oranges harvested per day by the number of days: 1650 oranges harvested per day x 87 days = 145,500 oranges harvested in total.\n\nThe answer is 145,500 oranges.", "answer": 143550.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/724.png"}
