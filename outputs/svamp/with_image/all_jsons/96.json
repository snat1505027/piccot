How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?", "qid": "96", "response": "First, we need to find out how many marbles Ed had initially. We know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so we can write:\n\nEd had x marbles\nDoug had x - 29 marbles\n\nNext, we know that Ed lost 17 marbles at the playground, so we can write:\n\nEd had x marbles\nDoug had x - 29 marbles\nEd lost 17 marbles\n\nNow, we need to find out how many marbles Ed had after losing 17 marbles. We can write:\n\nEd had x marbles\nDoug had x - 29 marbles\nEd lost 17 marbles\nEd had x - 17 marbles\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after losing 17 marbles. We can write:\n\nEd had x - 17 marbles\nDoug had x - 29 marbles\nDifference = x - 17 - (x - 29) = 12\n\nThe answer is 12.", "answer": 12.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/96.png"}
