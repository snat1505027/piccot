{"question": "In Haley's class some boys love to play marbles. If Haley has 10 marbles and she gave 5 marbles to each boy. How many boys did she give the marbles to?", "qid": "983", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boys Haley gave marbles to. We know that she gave 5 marbles to each boy. Let's call the number of boys \"x\".\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the information:\n\nx \\* 5 = 10\n\nNow, we can solve the equation by dividing both sides by 5:\n\nx = 10 / 5\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, Haley gave marbles to 2 boys.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/983.png"}
