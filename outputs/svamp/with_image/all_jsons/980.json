{"question": "10 red peaches and some more green peaches are in the basket. If there are a total of 15 peaches in the basket. How many green peaches are in the basket?", "qid": "980", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green peaches in the basket. We know that there are 10 red peaches and a total of 15 peaches in the basket. Let's call the number of green peaches x.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the information:\n\n10 + x = 15\n\nNow, we can solve the equation by adding 10 to both sides:\n\n10 + x = 15\nx = 15 - 10\nx = 5\n\nThere are 5 green peaches in the basket.\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/980.png"}
