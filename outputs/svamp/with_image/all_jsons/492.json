{"question": "Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week. How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?", "qid": "492", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season. We can do this by subtracting the rent he has to pay from his earnings.\n\nLewis earns $491 per week, and he has to pay $216 per week in rent. So, the amount he has left after paying the rent is $491 - $216 = $<<491-216=275>>275.\n\nSince the harvest season lasts for 1181 weeks, we can multiply the amount Lewis has left after paying the rent by the number of weeks in the harvest season to find out how much money he will have at the end of the harvest season.\n\n275 x 1181 = $<<275*1181=326375>>326375.\n\nThe answer is $326375.", "answer": 324775.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/492.png"}
