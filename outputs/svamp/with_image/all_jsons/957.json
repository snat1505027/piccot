{"question": "If each bag has 3 cookies and you had 21 cookies in total. How many bags of cookies do you have?", "qid": "957", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bags of cookies. We know that each bag has 3 cookies, and we have a total of 21 cookies. We can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the number of bags and the total number of cookies.\n\nLet's call the number of bags 'x'. We can write the proportion as:\n\nx / 3 = 21 / 3\n\nNow, we can simplify the proportion by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nx = 21\n\nSince we know that each bag has 3 cookies, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag:\n\nx = 21 / 3\nx = 7\n\nThe answer is 7 bags of cookies.", "answer": 7.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/957.png"}
