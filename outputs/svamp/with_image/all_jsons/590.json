{"question": "Lewis earns $ 403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 49 rent every week. How much money does he earn during harvest season?", "qid": "590", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season. We know that he earns $403 per week and that there are 233 weeks in the harvest season.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the number of weeks into a decimal. There are 233 weeks in the harvest season, so we can write it as 233/52 (since there are 52 weeks in a year). This gives us 4.4242 weeks per year.\n\nNext, we multiply the number of weeks per year by the amount Lewis earns per week to find the total amount of money he earns during the harvest season. 4.4242 weeks/year \\* $403/week = $1769.9888 per year.\n\nFinally, we need to convert this decimal to a whole number. Since the number is less than one, we can simply round it down to the nearest whole number. The answer is $1769.9888.", "answer": 93899.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/590.png"}
