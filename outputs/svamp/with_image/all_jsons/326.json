{"question": "There were 7 roses in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden which had a total of 59 roses. There are now 20 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?", "qid": "326", "response": "First, we need to find out how many roses were in the vase after Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden. We know that there are now 20 roses in the vase.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many roses were in the vase before Jessica cut some more roses. We know that the total number of roses in the vase after cutting is 20, and the total number of roses in the garden is 59.\n\nTo find the number of roses in the vase before cutting, we can subtract the number of roses cut from the total number of roses in the garden. 59 - 20 = 39.\n\nSo, Jessica cut 20 roses from her flower garden. The answer is 20.", "answer": 13.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/326.png"}
