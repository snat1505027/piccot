{"question": "Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?", "qid": "553", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bottle caps Danny had at first. We know that he found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park, so we can start by adding the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found:\n\n22 bottle caps + 8 wrappers = 30 items found at the park\n\nSince Danny now has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers in his collection, we can deduce that he found 30 items at the park and brought home 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers. To find the number of bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the total number of bottle caps he has now:\n\n28 bottle caps (found at home) - 28 bottle caps (found at the park) = 0 bottle caps\n\nThis means that Danny had 0 bottle caps at first. The answer is 0.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/553.png"}
