Paul had 71 books before the garage sale.\n2. He sold some books in the garage sale.\n3. After the garage sale, he bought 38 new books.\n4. He now has 116 books in total.\n\nTo find the difference between the number of books he bought and the number of books he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he has now.\n\n116 (total books) - 71 (books before garage sale) = <<116-71=45>>45 books bought in the garage sale.\n\nTherefore, Paul bought 45 more books than he sold.\n\nThe answer is 45.", "answer": 45.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/416.png"}
