Paul had x books at the start.\n2. He sold 137 books in the garage sale.\n3. After selling the books, he had 105 books left.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\nx - 137 = 105\n\nTo solve the equation, we can add 137 to both sides:\n\nx = 242\n\nSo, Paul had 242 books at the start.\n\nThe answer is 242.", "answer": 242.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/820.png"}
