If she still needs 2 more cups of flour. How many cups of flour did she put in?\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary has already put in. We can do this by subtracting the number of cups she still needs from the total number of cups required.\n\n12 cups of flour - 2 cups of flour = 10 cups of flour\n\nSince Mary has already put in some cups of flour, we can conclude that she has put in at least 10 cups of flour. The answer is 10 cups of flour.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/40.png"}
