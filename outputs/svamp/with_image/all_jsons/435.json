{"question": "Melissa scored 12 points in each game. If she scored a total of 36 points. How many games did she play?", "qid": "435", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of games Melissa played. We know that she scored 12 points in each game and a total of 36 points. We can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\nNumber of games = Total points / Points per game\n\nIn this case, the equation would be:\n\nNumber of games = 36 / 12\n\nTo solve the equation, we can multiply the total points by the points per game and then divide by the total points:\n\nNumber of games = 36 \\* 12 / 36\n\nNumber of games = 12\n\nThe answer is 12.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/435.png"}
