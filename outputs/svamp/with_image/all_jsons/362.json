{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?", "qid": "362", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of cups of sugar and salt that Mary needs to add.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of cups of sugar and salt that Mary needs to add. We can do this by adding the number of cups of sugar and salt that the recipe calls for: 6 cups of flour + 8 cups of sugar + 7 cups of salt = 21 cups.\n\nSince Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, she needs to add 21 cups - 5 cups = 16 cups of sugar and salt.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of cups of sugar and salt that Mary needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups of salt from the number of cups of sugar: 16 cups of sugar - 7 cups of salt = 9 cups.\n\nThe answer is 9 cups.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/362.png"}
