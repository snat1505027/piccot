We can add the number of cookies and candies together: 28 cookies + 86 candies = 114.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of bags of cookies. Since there are 14 bags with an equal number of cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags: 114 cookies \u00f7 14 bags = 8 cookies per bag.\n\nTherefore, we have 14 bags of cookies.\n\nThe answer is 14 bags of cookies.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/565.png"}
