{"question": "Brenda's mother made cookies for guests. Each guest had 2 cookies. If she prepared a total of 10 cookies. How many guests did she prepare cookies for?", "qid": "446", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of guests for whom the cookies were prepared. We know that each guest received 2 cookies, and there were a total of 10 cookies prepared.\n\nLet's start by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per guest:\n10 cookies \u00f7 2 cookies per guest = 5 guests\n\nHowever, the answer is not correct, as there is a red question mark on the image. This indicates that there might be an error or a missing piece of information.\n\nLet's try another approach. We can find the number of guests by multiplying the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per guest and then rounding the result to the nearest whole number.\n\n10 cookies \u00d7 2 cookies per guest = 20 cookies\n\nSince there are 20 cookies, we can round up to the nearest whole number of guests, which is 21 guests.\n\nThe answer is 21 guests.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/446.png"}
