{"question": "Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?", "qid": "280", "response": "First, we need to find the weight Jessie lost in the first week. We know that she lost 62 kilograms in the first week.\n\nNext, we need to find the weight Jessie lost in the second week. We know that she lost 140 kilograms in the second week.\n\nNow, we need to add the weight Jessie lost in both weeks to find her total weight loss. We add 62 kilograms and 140 kilograms to find the total weight loss.\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the total weight loss from Jessie's current weight to find her weight before starting to jog. We subtract the total weight loss from 9 kilograms to find the answer.\n\nThe answer is 9 - (62 + 140) = 9 - 202 = -193 kilograms.", "answer": 211.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/280.png"}
