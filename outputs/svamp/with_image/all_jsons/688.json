{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 21 classrooms. There are 98 students in the school and 7 school buses. If all buses are full. How many seats are in each bus?", "qid": "688", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of seats in the buses. We can do this by multiplying the number of buses by the number of seats per bus.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of seats per bus. We can do this by dividing the total number of seats by the number of buses.\n\nThe total number of seats is 98 students. There are 7 buses.\n\nSeats per bus = Total seats / Number of buses\nSeats per bus = 98 / 7\nSeats per bus = 13.857142857142857\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a seat, we need to round the number of seats per bus to the nearest whole number.\n\nNumber of seats per bus = 14\n\nNow, we can find the total number of seats in the buses by multiplying the number of buses by the number of seats per bus.\n\nTotal seats in buses = Number of buses x Seats per bus\nTotal seats in buses = 7 x 14\nTotal seats in buses = 98\n\nThe answer is 98.", "answer": 14.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/688.png"}
