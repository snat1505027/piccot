{"question": "28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?", "qid": "4", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and the number of children who got off the bus.\n\nFirst, we know that there were 28 children riding on the bus initially.\n\nNext, we know that 82 children got on the bus at the bus stop, and some got off the bus.\n\nTo find the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop, we need to add the number of children who got on the bus to the number of children who were already on the bus.\n\n82 children got on the bus + 28 children already on the bus = 110 children on the bus.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of children who got off the bus. We can do this by subtracting the total number of children on the bus from the initial number of children on the bus.\n\n110 children on the bus - 28 children already on the bus = 82 children got off the bus.\n\nFinally, we can find the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and the number of children who got off the bus by subtracting the number of children who got off the bus from the number of children who got on the bus.\n\n82 children got on the bus - 82 children got off the bus = 0 children more got on the bus than got off.\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/4.png"}
