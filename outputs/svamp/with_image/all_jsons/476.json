{"question": "Lewis earns $ 2 every week during the harvest. If he earns a total of $ 178. How many weeks did the harvest last?", "qid": "476", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of weeks the harvest lasted. We know that Lewis earns $2 per week during the harvest, and the total amount he earned is $178.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of weeks that Lewis earned $2. We can do this by dividing the total amount he earned by the amount he earned per week:\n\n$178 \u00f7 $2 = 89.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a week, we need to round the number of weeks to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up to 90 weeks.\n\nThe answer is: Lewis harvested for 90 weeks.", "answer": 89.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/476.png"}
