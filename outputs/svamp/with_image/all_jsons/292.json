{"question": "Lucy went to the grocery store. She bought 23 packs of cookie and some packs of cake. In total she had 27 packs of grocery. How many packs of cake did she buy in all?", "qid": "292", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of packs of cake Lucy bought. We know that she bought 23 packs of cookies and some packs of cake. Let's call the number of packs of cake \"x\".\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the information we have:\n23 + x = 27 (total packs of grocery)\n\nNow we need to solve the equation to find the value of \"x\". To do this, we can subtract 23 from both sides of the equation:\nx = 27 - 23\nx = 4\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/292.png"}
