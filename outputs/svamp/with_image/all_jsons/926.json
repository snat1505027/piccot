{"question": "Matthew had 24 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left. How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?", "qid": "926", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crackers Matthew gave to his friends. Let's start by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Matthew had 24 crackers.\n2. He gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends.\n3. He still had 17 crackers left.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend. To do this, we can divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends.\n\n24 crackers \u00f7 3 friends = 8 crackers per friend\n\nNow that we know Matthew gave 8 crackers to each friend, we can find the total number of crackers he gave to his friends.\n\n8 crackers per friend \u00d7 3 friends = 24 crackers\n\nSince Matthew still had 17 crackers left, we can add the total number of crackers he gave to his friends to find the final answer.\n\n24 crackers (given to friends) + 17 crackers (left) = 41 crackers\n\nThe answer is 41 crackers.", "answer": 7.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/926.png"}
