{"question": "Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. Allan then bought 3 more balloons at the park. How many more balloons did Jake have than Allan in the park?", "qid": "845", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of balloons Allan has. Allan brought 2 balloons and bought 3 more at the park, so he has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of balloons Jake has. Jake brought 6 balloons and Allan bought 3 more balloons at the park, so Jake has 6 + 3 = 9 balloons.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of balloons Jake has and the number of balloons Allan has. Jake has 9 balloons, and Allan has 5 balloons, so the difference is 9 - 5 = 4.\n\nThe answer is Jake has 4 more balloons than Allan in the park.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/845.png"}
