{"question": "David did 27 more push-ups but 7 less crunches than Zachary in gym class today. If Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches. How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?", "qid": "778", "response": "Let's start by finding the number of push-ups Zachary did. We know that Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches. Since David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, we can find the number of push-ups David did by adding 27 to the number of push-ups Zachary did.\n\n5 push-ups + 27 = 32 push-ups\n\nNow, we know that David did 32 push-ups and 7 less crunches than Zachary. Since Zachary did 17 crunches, we can find the number of crunches David did by subtracting 7 from the number of crunches Zachary did.\n\n17 crunches - 7 = 10 crunches\n\nSince Zachary did 17 crunches and David did 10 crunches, we can find the difference between the number of crunches Zachary did and the number of crunches David did by subtracting 10 from 17.\n\n17 crunches - 10 crunches = 7 crunches\n\nThe answer is 7 crunches.", "answer": 12.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/778.png"}
