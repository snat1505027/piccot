We can use the information that he sold 145 cakes and still has 72 cakes left.\n\nLet's start by using the information that he sold 145 cakes. We can represent this as 145 cakes sold.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of cakes he made. Since he still has 72 cakes left, we can represent this as 72 cakes left.\n\nTo find the number of cakes he made, we can subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of cakes he still has. We can do this by subtracting 145 from 72.\n\n145 - 72 = 73\n\nThe answer is 73.", "answer": 217.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/276.png"}
