{"question": "Debby bought 264 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 15 bottles a day for 11 days. How many bottles does she have left?", "qid": "856", "response": "First, we need to calculate the total number of water bottles Debby drank. She drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, so she drank 15 x 11 = <<15*11=165>>165 bottles.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of bottles she drank from the number of bottles she bought. She bought 264 bottles and drank 165 bottles, so she has 264 - 165 = <<264-165=99>>99 bottles left.\n\nThe answer is 99.", "answer": 99.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/856.png"}
