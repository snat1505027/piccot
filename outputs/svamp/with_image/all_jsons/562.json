We know that there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls. So, the total number of students in the school is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of boys in the school. We can do this by adding 510 to the number of girls:\n635 + 510 = 1145\n\nNow that we have the number of boys, we can find the total number of students in the school by adding the number of girls and the number of boys:\n635 + 1145 = 1780\n\nThe answer is 1780.", "answer": 1145.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/562.png"}
