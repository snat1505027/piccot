{"question": "Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11. If each group has 2 eggs. How many eggs does Rebecca have?", "qid": "696", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of eggs Rebecca has and then divide it by the number of groups she wants to create.\n\n1. First, we need to find the total number of eggs Rebecca has. We can do this by multiplying the number of eggs per group by the number of groups she wants to create.\n\n11 eggs per group \u00d7 11 groups = 121 eggs\n\n2. Now, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of groups to find the average number of eggs per group.\n\n121 eggs \u00f7 11 groups = 11 eggs per group\n\n3. Since Rebecca wants to split the eggs into groups of 11, we can simply say that she has 11 eggs per group.\n\nThe answer is 11 eggs per group.", "answer": 22.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/696.png"}
