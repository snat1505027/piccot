{"question": "In a school there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 281 more girls than boys. How many pupils are there in that school?", "qid": "912", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pupils in the school. We know that there are 868 girls and 281 more girls than boys. So, we can start by finding the number of boys in the school.\n\nLet's call the number of boys \"x\". Since there are 281 more girls than boys, we can write the equation:\n\nGirls = Boys + 281\n\nWe know that the number of girls is 868, so we can substitute that value into the equation:\n\n868 = x + 281\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"x\". To do this, we can subtract 868 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 868 - 281\n\nx = 587\n\nSo, there are 587 boys in the school. Now, we can find the total number of pupils by adding the number of boys to the number of girls:\n\nTotal pupils = Girls + Boys\n\nTotal pupils = 868 + 587\n\nTotal pupils = 1455\n\nThe answer is 1455.", "answer": 1455.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/912.png"}
