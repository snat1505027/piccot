{"question": "Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. He has 4 apples more than adam and jackie together do. How many apples does he have?", "qid": "847", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of apples that Adam and Jackie have together. We can do this by adding the number of apples each person has: 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of apples Jackie has. We know that Jackie has 4 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so we can find the number of apples Jackie has by adding 4 to the total number of apples: 10 + 4 = 14.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of apples Adam has. We can do this by subtracting the number of apples Jackie has from the total number of apples: 10 - 14 = -4. Since we cannot have a negative number of apples, we can conclude that Adam does not have any apples.\n\nThe answer is 14.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/847.png"}
