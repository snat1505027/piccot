It also shows that the initial number of action figures was 3, and 7 more were added to the shelf. To find the initial number of action figures, we can use the equation:\n\nInitial number of action figures + 7 = Total number of action figures\n\n3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, Jerry initially had 3 action figures on the shelf. The answer is 3.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/6.png"}
