{"question": "Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill. If Jill has 87 peaches. How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?", "qid": "179", "response": "First, we need to find the number of peaches Jake has. Since Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, we can calculate the number of peaches Jake has by subtracting 18 from Jill's number and then adding 5 to the result.\n\n87 (Jill's peaches) - 18 = 69\n69 + 5 = 74\n\nSo, Jake has 74 peaches.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill. To do this, we can subtract Jill's number of peaches (87) from Jake's number of peaches (74).\n\n87 - 74 = 13\n\nThe answer is 13.", "answer": 13.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/179.png"}
