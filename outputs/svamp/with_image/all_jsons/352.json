{"question": "They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have 14 chairs for each set of table. If they have 9 sets of tables. How many more chairs than tables do they have?", "qid": "352", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of chairs. We know that there are 14 chairs per set of tables, and we have 9 sets of tables. So, the total number of chairs is 14 x 9 = 126 chairs.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of tables. We know that there are 9 sets of tables, and each set has 14 chairs. So, the total number of tables is 9 x 14 = 126 tables.\n\nSince the number of chairs is more than the number of tables, we can conclude that they have more chairs than tables. The answer is 126 chairs more than tables.", "answer": 117.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/352.png"}
