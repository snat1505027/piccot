{"question": "Brenda's mother made 14 cookies for 2 guests. If each of them had the same number of cookies. How many did each of them have?", "qid": "81", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies for each guest. We know that Brenda's mother made 14 cookies and there are 2 guests. We can use the information provided in the image to find the answer.\n\nThe image shows a table with the number of cookies made for 2 guests. The table has 14 rows, and the number of cookies for each guest is 2.\n\nTo find the number of cookies for each guest, we can count the number of rows in the table, which is 14. Since the number of cookies for each guest is 2, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of cookies per guest to get the answer.\n\n14 rows \\* 2 cookies per guest = 28 cookies for each guest.\n\nThe answer is 28.", "answer": 7.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/81.png"}
