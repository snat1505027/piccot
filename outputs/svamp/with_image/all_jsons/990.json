{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron. How deep was the water?", "qid": "990", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the depth of the water. We know that Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron. So, Dean's height is 15 - 6 = 9 feet.\n\nThe depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 9 x 9 = 81 feet.\n\nThe answer is 81 feet.", "answer": 81.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/990.png"}
