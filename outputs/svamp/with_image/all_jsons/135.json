{"question": "A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes. How many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left?", "qid": "135", "response": "First, we need to find out how many potatoes the farmer picked. We know that he picked 172 potatoes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many potatoes the farmer had initially. We know that he had 77 potatoes initially.\n\nNow, we can find out how many potatoes the farmer has left by subtracting the number of potatoes he picked from the initial number of potatoes. 77 potatoes - 172 potatoes = -95 potatoes.\n\nSince the number of potatoes the farmer has left is negative, we know that he has more potatoes left than he initially had.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many tomatoes the farmer had initially. We know that he had 175 tomatoes initially.\n\nFinally, we can find out how many tomatoes the farmer has left by subtracting the number of tomatoes he picked from the initial number of tomatoes. 175 tomatoes - 172 tomatoes = 3 tomatoes.\n\nThe answer is 3 tomatoes and 95 potatoes.", "answer": 80.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/135.png"}
