We have 3 birds and 2 storks initially, and then 5 more birds join them. So, the total number of birds is 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of storks. We have 2 storks initially, and then 5 more birds join them. So, the total number of storks is 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of birds and storks on the fence by adding the total number of birds and the total number of storks. The total number of birds and storks is 8 + 7 = 15.\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/669.png"}
