How many push-ups did David do?", "qid": "768", "response": "First, we need to find the difference in the number of push-ups between Zachary and David. Zachary did 59 push-ups, and David did 19 more push-ups, so David did 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups.\n\nNext, we need to find the difference in the number of crunches between Zachary and David. Zachary did 44 crunches, and David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so David did 44 - 27 = 17 crunches.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of push-ups and crunches that David did by adding the number of push-ups and crunches. David did 78 push-ups and 17 crunches, so the total is 78 + 17 = 95.\n\nThe answer is 95.", "answer": 78.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/768.png"}
