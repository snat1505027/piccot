We can do this by multiplying the number of seats (6) by the number of people each seat can hold (14).\n\n6 seats x 14 people per seat = 84 people\n\nNow, we know that there are 16 people on the wheel right now. To find out how many more people can join the wheel, we need to subtract the current number of people from the total number of people the wheel can hold.\n\n84 people - 16 people = 68 people\n\nThe answer is 68 people.", "answer": 68.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/486.png"}
