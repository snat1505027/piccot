{"question": "Matthew had 8 crackers to give to friends. If Matthew gave 2 crackers to each his friends. How many friends did he give crackers to?", "qid": "457", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of friends Matthew gave crackers to. We know that he gave 2 crackers to each friend.\n\nLet's start by finding the total number of crackers Matthew had. We can do this by multiplying the number of crackers he had by the number of crackers he gave to each friend.\n\n8 crackers \\* 2 crackers/friend = <<8*2=16>>16 crackers\n\nNow, we need to find the number of friends he gave crackers to. To do this, we can divide the total number of crackers by the number of crackers he gave to each friend.\n\n16 crackers / 2 crackers/friend = <<16/2=8>>8 friends\n\nThe answer is 8 friends.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/457.png"}
