{"question": "Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. If Jill has 12 peaches. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?", "qid": "812", "response": "First, we need to find the number of peaches Steven has. We know that Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, so we can calculate that by adding 15 to Jill's 12 peaches.\n\n12 + 15 = 27\n\nNext, we know that Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can calculate Jake's peaches by subtracting 16 from Steven's 27.\n\n27 - 16 = 11\n\nNow, we can find the difference between Jill's and Jake's peaches. We know that Jill has 12 peaches, and Jake has 11 peaches.\n\n12 - 11 = 1\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/812.png"}
