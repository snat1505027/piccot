{"question": "Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into 4 groups. Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 marbles. How many eggs will each group have?", "qid": "637", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of eggs and marbles. The image shows 8 eggs and 6 marbles.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of groups. The image shows 4 groups.\n\nNow, we can divide the total number of eggs and marbles by the total number of groups to find the number of eggs per group.\n\n8 eggs \u00f7 4 groups = 2 eggs per group\n\n6 marbles \u00f7 4 groups = 1.5 marbles per group (we can't have a fraction of a marble, so we'll round up to 2 marbles per group)\n\nThe answer is: Each group will have 2 eggs and 2 marbles.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/637.png"}
