{"question": "5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?", "qid": "498", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of children who got off the bus and the total number of children on the bus.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of children on the bus. We know that 5 children were riding on the bus initially, and then 63 children got off the bus. We also know that some more children got on the bus, but we don't know the exact number. So, we can assume that the total number of children on the bus is 63 + the number of children who got on the bus.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of children who got on the bus. We don't know the exact number, but we can estimate it by looking at the image. The image shows a bus with a large number of children on it, which suggests that a significant number of children got on the bus after the initial 5 children.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of children who got off the bus and the total number of children on the bus. We can do this by subtracting the number of children who got off the bus (63) from the total number of children on the bus (63 + the number of children who got on the bus).\n\nThe answer is: The number of children who got on the bus is greater than the number of children who got off the bus.", "answer": 9.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/498.png"}
