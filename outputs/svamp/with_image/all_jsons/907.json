{"question": "Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. He ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 salty cookies. How many salty cookies did Paco have left?", "qid": "907", "response": "Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies initially. He ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 salty cookies, leaving him with 9 - 36 = -27 sweet cookies. Since cookies cannot have a negative number, we need to add 6 more cookies to make it a positive number. Therefore, Paco had 9 + 6 = 15 sweet cookies left.\n\nTo find out how many salty cookies Paco had left, we need to subtract the number of salty cookies he ate from the initial number of salty cookies. Paco ate 3 salty cookies, so he had 6 - 3 = 3 salty cookies left.\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/907.png"}
