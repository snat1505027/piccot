Let's start by using the information given in the image:\n\n1. 166 more students suggested bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes.\n2. 182 students suggested mashed potatoes.\n\nWe can use the difference between the two numbers to find the number of students who suggested bacon:\n\n166 (more students suggested bacon) - 182 (students suggested mashed potatoes) = -16\n\nSince the number of students who suggested bacon is 166 more than those who suggested mashed potatoes, and there are 182 students who suggested mashed potatoes, we can find the number of students who suggested bacon by adding 166 to 182:\n\n182 (students suggested mashed potatoes) + 166 (more students suggested bacon) = 348\n\nThe answer is 348.", "answer": 348.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/714.png"}
