After cutting, there are 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase.\n\nTo find the total number of roses and orchids, we add the initial number of roses and orchids to the number of roses and orchids after cutting:\n\n6 roses + 20 orchids + 22 roses = 48 roses and orchids in total.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of roses and orchids. There are 22 roses and 21 orchids, so the difference is 22 - 21 = 1.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/739.png"}
