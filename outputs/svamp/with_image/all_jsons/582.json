If she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework, it means she had to complete 3 more pages of reading homework.\n\nLet's assume the number of pages of reading homework is x.\n\nSo, the total number of pages Rachel had to complete in all is:\n\n8 + x\n\nSince Rachel had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework, we can write:\n\nMath homework = Reading homework + 3\n\nMath homework = 8 + x + 3\n\nSubstituting this in the total number of pages, we get:\n\n8 + x + 3 = 8 + x + 3\n\nThe answer is 8 + x + 3.", "answer": 13.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/582.png"}
