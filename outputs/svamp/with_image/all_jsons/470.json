{"question": "Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?", "qid": "470", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can write:\n\nEd = Doug + 2\n\nDoug lost some marbles at the playground, so we can write:\n\nDoug = Doug - x\n\nNow, we know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so we can write:\n\nEd = Doug + 19\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\nDoug = Doug - x + 19\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nDoug = 19 - x\n\nSince we know that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:\n\nEd = Doug + 2 = 19 - x + 2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nEd = 21 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of Ed into the second equation to solve for x:\n\n21 - x = 19 - x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x = 2\n\nx = 1\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 17.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/470.png"}
