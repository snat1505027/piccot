{"question": "Rachel picked 2 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 7 apples still on it. If 6 of those are ripe and the rest are unripe. How many ripe apples did the tree have to begin with?", "qid": "237", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of ripe apples on the tree. Let's start by using the information provided in the image. Rachel picked 2 ripe apples, so the tree had 7 apples initially (2 ripe apples + 6 ripe apples).\n\nNext, we need to find the number of unripe apples on the tree. The image shows that there are 6 ripe apples and 1 unripe apple. Since there are 7 apples in total, the number of unripe apples is 7 - 6 = 1.\n\nNow, we can find the initial number of ripe apples on the tree by subtracting the number of unripe apples from the total number of apples. The initial number of ripe apples is 7 - 1 = 6.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 8.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/237.png"}
