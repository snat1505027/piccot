{"question": "There were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?", "qid": "333", "response": "First, we need to find out how many roses were originally in the vase. Since there are now 23 roses in the vase, we can start by subtracting the number of roses that were thrown away (4) from the current number of roses (23).\n\n23 - 4 = 19\n\nNext, we need to find out how many roses were cut from the garden to replace the thrown-away roses. We can do this by subtracting the number of roses that were thrown away from the current number of roses in the vase.\n\n19 - 4 = 15\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 25.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/333.png"}
