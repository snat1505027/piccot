{"question": "Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines after 57 stops. He was told by 252 of the pickers that they fill 108 drums of grapes per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days?", "qid": "961", "response": "First, we need to find the number of drums filled per day. We know that 252 pickers fill 108 drums of grapes per day. To find the number of drums filled per day, we can divide the number of drums filled by the number of pickers:\n\n108 drums filled / 252 pickers = 0.43 drums filled per picker per day\n\nNext, we need to find the number of drums filled in 58 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of drums filled per day by the number of days:\n\n0.43 drums filled per picker per day \\* 58 days = 254.4 drums filled in 58 days\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a drum, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number. The answer is 255 drums filled in 58 days.", "answer": 6264.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/961.png"}
