We know that Mary already added 2 cups of flour, so she needs to add 12 - 2 = <<12-2=10>>10 cups of flour.\n2. We know that she needs to add 7 cups of salt.\n3. To find the difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of salt, we subtract 7 from 10: 10 - 7 = <<10-7=3>>3.\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/461.png"}
