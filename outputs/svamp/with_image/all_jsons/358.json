If 47 bird families flew away to africa and 94 bird families flew away to asia. How many more bird families flew away to asia than those that flew away to africa?", "qid": "358", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Asia and the number of bird families that flew away to Africa.\n\nFirst, we add the number of bird families that flew away to both Africa and Asia: 47 + 94 = 141.\n\nThen, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Africa from the total number of bird families that flew away: 141 - 47 = 94.\n\nSo, there are 94 more bird families that flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa.\n\nThe answer is 94.", "answer": 47.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/358.png"}
