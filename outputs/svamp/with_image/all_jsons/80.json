{"question": "36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?", "qid": "80", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of children who got off the bus and the number of children who got on the bus.\n\nFirst, we know that 36 children were riding on the bus initially.\nThen, 68 children got off the bus, and some more got on the bus.\nSo, the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop is 36 + 68 + some more children.\n\nTo find the number of children who got on the bus, we can subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children on the bus.\n36 + 68 + some more children = 104 children.\n104 - 68 = 36 children.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of children who got off the bus.\n36 children got off the bus, and some more children got on the bus.\nSo, the number of children who got off the bus is 36 + some more children.\n\nTo find the number of children who got on the bus, we can subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children on the bus.\n104 - 36 = 68 children.\n\nFinally, we can find the difference between the number of children who got off the bus and the number of children who got on the bus.\n36 - 68 = -32 children.\n\nThe answer is -32 children.", "answer": 24.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/80.png"}
