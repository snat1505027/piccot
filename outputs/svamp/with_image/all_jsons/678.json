{"question": "Matthew had 23 crackers. He has 11 crackers left after he gave equal numbers of crackers to his 2 friends. How many crackers did each friend eat?", "qid": "678", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crackers each friend ate. We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Matthew had 23 crackers initially.\n2. He gave equal numbers of crackers to his 2 friends.\n3. After giving crackers to his friends, he has 11 crackers left.\n\nLet's start by finding the total number of crackers Matthew's friends ate. We can do this by using the information that he gave equal numbers of crackers to his friends.\n\n2 friends \u00d7 equal number of crackers = 2 \u00d7 x\n\nNow, we can find the number of crackers each friend ate by dividing the total number of crackers they ate by the number of friends.\n\n2 \u00d7 x \u00f7 2 = x\n\nNow, we can find the value of x by multiplying the result by 2.\n\nx = 2 \u00d7 x \u00f7 2\nx = 2x\n\nNow, we can find the number of crackers Matthew's friends ate by adding the value of x to the number of crackers he has left.\n\n2 \u00d7 x + 11 = 2x + 11\n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 11 from both sides of the equation.\n\n2 \u00d7 x + 11 - 11 = 2x - 11\n2 \u00d7 x = 2x - 11\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, we can simplify the equation by removing the 2 from both sides.\n\nx = x - 11\nx = x - 11\n\nNow, we can find the value of x by solving for x.\n\nx = x - 11\nx = x - 11\nx = x - 11\n\nThe answer is x.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/678.png"}
