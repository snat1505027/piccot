{"question": "Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 2 feet wide. What is the length of her room?", "qid": "277", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the room. We know that the room is 2 feet wide, and we need a carpet of 10 square feet. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the room.\n\nLet's start by drawing a right triangle with the width of the room as the base (b) and the length of the room as the hypotenuse (h). The carpet size is the square root of the area of the triangle, which is equal to the length of the room.\n\nb^2 = h^2 + (carpet size)^2\n\n2^2 = h^2 + (10)^2\n\n4 = h^2 + 100\n\nh^2 = 36\n\nh = 6\n\nThe length of the room is 6 feet.\n\nThe answer is 6 feet.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/277.png"}
