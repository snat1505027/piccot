{"question": "Faye had 31 packs of pencils each one having 6 pencils. She was placing her pencils into rows with 19 pencils in each row. How many pencils does she have?", "qid": "635", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pencils Faye has. We can do this by multiplying the number of packs (31) by the number of pencils in each pack (6).\n\n31 packs of pencils \\* 6 pencils per pack = 186 pencils\n\nSince Faye is placing her pencils into rows with 19 pencils in each row, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row.\n\n186 pencils \u00f7 19 pencils per row = 9.7 pencils per row\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a pencil, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of pencils per row.\n\n9.7 pencils per row \u2248 10 pencils per row\n\nNow, we can find the total number of rows by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per row.\n\n186 pencils \u00f7 10 pencils per row = 18.6 rows\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a row, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of rows.\n\n18.6 rows \u2248 19 rows\n\nThe answer is 19 rows of 10 pencils each, for a total of 190 pencils.", "answer": 186.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/635.png"}
