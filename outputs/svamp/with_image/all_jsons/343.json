{"question": "A book has 2 chapters. The first chapter is 37 pages long. The second chapter is 80 pages long. How many more pages does the second chapter have than the first chapter?", "qid": "343", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of pages in the second chapter and the first chapter.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of pages in both chapters. We can do this by adding the number of pages in the first chapter and the number of pages in the second chapter.\n\n37 + 80 = 117\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of pages in the second chapter and the first chapter. To do this, we subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages.\n\n117 - 37 = 80\n\nSo, the second chapter has 80 pages, which is 43 pages more than the first chapter.", "answer": 43.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/343.png"}
