How many days did she drink for?", "qid": "307", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days Debby drank water bottles. We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Debby bought 301 water bottles.\n2. She drank 144 bottles a day for some days.\n3. She has 157 bottles left.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of bottles Debby drank in total.\n\n144 bottles a day \\* number of days = Total bottles drank\n\nNext, we need to find the number of days Debby drank water bottles.\n\nTotal bottles drank - Bottles left = Number of days drank\n\n144 bottles a day \\* number of days = 301 bottles - 157 bottles\n\nNow, we can solve the equation:\n\n144 bottles a day \\* number of days = 143 bottles\n\nSince Debby drank 143 bottles, we can find the number of days by dividing the total bottles drank by the number of bottles drank per day:\n\nNumber of days = Total bottles drank / Bottles drank per day\n\nNumber of days = 143 bottles / 144 bottles a day\n\nNumber of days = 1\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/307.png"}
