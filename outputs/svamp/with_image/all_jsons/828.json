We know that 11 nails are used for securing large planks of wood, and each plank needs 3 pieces of nails. So, the total number of nails used for securing the planks would be 11 nails per plank x the number of planks.\n\nAdditionally, we know that there are 8 extra nails used. So, we need to add the total number of nails used for securing the planks to the extra nails.\n\nThe total number of nails used for securing the planks would be 11 nails per plank x the number of planks + 8 extra nails.\n\nThe answer is 11 nails per plank x the number of planks + 8 extra nails.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/828.png"}
