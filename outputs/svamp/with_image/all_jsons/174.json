{"question": "Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 5 peaches. How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?", "qid": "174", "response": "First, we need to find the number of peaches Jill has. Since Steven has 5 peaches and Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 5 - 3 = 2 peaches.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of peaches Jill has. Since Jake has 2 peaches and Jill has 3 more peaches than Jake, Jill has 2 + 3 = 5 peaches.\n\nNow we can find the difference between the number of peaches Jake has and Jill has. Jake has 2 peaches, and Jill has 5 peaches, so the difference is 5 - 2 = 3 peaches.\n\nThe answer is Jake has 3 more peaches than Jill.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/174.png"}
