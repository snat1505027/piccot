{"question": "Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day. How many days will it take to fill 240 drums of grapes?", "qid": "671", "response": "First, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are filled per day by the pickers. We know that 36 pickers fill 8 drums of grapes per day.\n\n36 pickers x 8 drums/picker = 288 drums filled per day\n\nNext, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are needed to fill 240 drums. We can do this by dividing 240 by the number of drums filled per day.\n\n240 drums / 288 drums filled per day = 83.33\n\nSince we can't fill a fraction of a drum, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of drums.\n\n83.33 drums rounded up to the nearest whole number = 84 drums\n\nNow we can find out how many days it will take to fill 84 drums of grapes. We can do this by dividing the number of drums needed by the number of drums filled per day.\n\n84 drums needed / 8 drums filled per day = 10.5 days\n\nThe answer is 10.5 days.", "answer": 30.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/671.png"}
