{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. She already put in 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?", "qid": "430", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how much flour Mary needs to add to reach the total amount of flour required by the recipe.\n\nThe image shows that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar.\n\nTo find out how much more flour Mary needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added (3 cups) from the total amount of flour required by the recipe (9 cups).\n\n3 cups - 9 cups = -6 cups\n\nSince we cannot have a negative amount of flour, we need to add the same amount of flour to the recipe to balance the total amount of flour.\n\n3 cups + 62 cups = 65 cups\n\nThe answer is 65 cups.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/430.png"}
