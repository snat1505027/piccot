{"question": "Jake has 6 fewer peaches and 8 more apples than Steven. Steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples. How many more peaches than apples does Steven have?", "qid": "532", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of peaches and apples that Steven has. Steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples, so the total number of fruits he has is 17 + 16 = 33.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of peaches and apples that Jake has. Jake has 6 fewer peaches and 8 more apples than Steven, so he has 17 - 6 = 11 peaches and 16 + 8 = 24 apples. The total number of fruits Jake has is 11 + 24 = 35.\n\nNow, we can find the difference in the number of peaches and apples between Steven and Jake. The difference in the number of peaches is 17 - 11 = 6. The difference in the number of apples is 16 - 24 = -8. Since the difference in apples is negative, we need to add it to the number of peaches to find the total difference. The total difference is 6 + (-8) = -2.\n\nThe answer is Steven has 2 more peaches than apples.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/532.png"}
