Now, we need to find the total number of pupils in the school. We know that there are 842 boys and 700 girls, so we can add these two numbers together to find the total:\n\n842 boys + 700 girls = 1542 pupils\n\nThe answer is 1542.", "answer": 1542.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/254.png"}
