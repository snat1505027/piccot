{"question": "Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven who has 14 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 15 peaches. How many peaches does Jake have?", "qid": "491", "response": "First, we need to find the number of peaches Jill has. Since Steven has 15 peaches and Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, we can find Jill's peaches by subtracting 7 from 15:\n\n15 - 7 = 8\n\nNow, we know that Jill has 8 peaches. Since Steven has 15 peaches and Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, we can find Jake's peaches by subtracting 7 from 15:\n\n15 - 7 = 8\n\nHowever, we already found that Jill has 8 peaches, so Jake must have 7 peaches.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 8.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/491.png"}
