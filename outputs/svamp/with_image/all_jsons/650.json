{"question": "Rachel has 3 apple trees. She picked 8 apples from each of her trees. Now the trees have a total 9 apples still on them. How many apples were there on all trees initially?", "qid": "650", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of apples on all trees. Let's start by using the information provided in the image.\n\nRachel has 3 apple trees.\nShe picked 8 apples from each tree.\nThe trees have a total of 9 apples still on them.\n\nWe can represent this information in a table:\n\n| Number of trees | Number of apples picked | Number of apples left on trees |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 3 | 8 | 9 |\n\nNow, we need to find the initial number of apples on all trees. To do this, we can multiply the number of apples picked by the number of trees:\n\n8 (apples picked) \\* 3 (trees) = 24 apples\n\nHowever, this doesn't match the total number of apples left on the trees, which is 9. This means that there is a discrepancy in the information provided.\n\nThe answer is 24 apples.", "answer": 33.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/650.png"}
