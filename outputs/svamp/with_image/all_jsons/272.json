{"question": "A mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house in each of the 81 blocks. If there are 12 houses in each block. How many pieces of junk mail should he give in each block?", "qid": "272", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces of junk mail the mailman should give in each block. We can start by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. The mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house in each block.\n2. There are 12 houses in each block.\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the number of houses and the number of pieces of junk mail. Let's call the number of pieces of junk mail per house \"x\".\n\nWe can write the proportion as:\n\nx/12 = 4/x\n\nTo solve for \"x\", we can cross-multiply:\n\nx^2 = 48\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of both sides:\n\nx = \u221a48\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, the mailman should give 8 pieces of junk mail in each block.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 48.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/272.png"}
