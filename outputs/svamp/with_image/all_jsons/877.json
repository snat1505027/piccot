{"question": "Matthew had 31 crackers. He has 23 crackers left after he gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends. How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?", "qid": "877", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crackers Matthew gave to his friends. We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Matthew had 31 crackers initially.\n2. He gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend. Since he gave equal numbers of crackers to each friend, we can divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends.\n\n31 crackers \u00f7 5 friends = 6.2 crackers per friend\n\nSince we cannot give a fraction of a cracker, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n6.2 crackers per friend \u2248 6 crackers per friend\n\nNow, we can find the total number of crackers Matthew gave to his friends by multiplying the number of crackers per friend by the number of friends.\n\n6 crackers per friend \u00d7 5 friends = 30 crackers\n\nSince Matthew had 31 crackers initially, he gave away 1 crackers to his friends.\n\nThe answer is 30 crackers.", "answer": 8.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/877.png"}
