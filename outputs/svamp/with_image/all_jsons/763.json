{"question": "Paul got a box of 267 crayons for his birthday. During the school year he lost 231 crayons while he gave away 308 crayons to his friends. How many more crayons did he give to his friends than those he lost?", "qid": "763", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of crayons given to friends and the number of crayons lost.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of crayons given to friends. We can do this by adding the number of crayons given to friends (308) to the number of crayons initially received (267).\n\n267 + 308 = 575\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of crayons lost. We can do this by subtracting the number of crayons initially received (267) from the total number of crayons given to friends (575).\n\n575 - 267 = 308\n\nNow we have the total number of crayons lost (308) and the total number of crayons given to friends (575). To find the difference, we can subtract the number of crayons lost from the total number of crayons given to friends.\n\n575 - 308 = 267\n\nThe answer is 267.", "answer": 77.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/763.png"}
