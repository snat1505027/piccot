{"question": "David did 51 push-ups in gym class today. David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary. How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?", "qid": "913", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of push-ups Zachary and David did together.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of push-ups Zachary did. We know that David did 51 push-ups and Zachary did 49 fewer push-ups than David. So, Zachary did 51 - 49 = 2 push-ups.\n\nNext, we need to add the number of push-ups Zachary did to the number of push-ups David did to find the total number of push-ups they did together. So, the total number of push-ups is 51 + 2 = 53.\n\nThe answer is 53.", "answer": 53.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/913.png"}
