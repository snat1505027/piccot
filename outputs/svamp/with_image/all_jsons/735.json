{"question": "Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 41 bird families living near the mountain. If 35 bird families flew away to asia and 62 bird families flew away to africa. How many more bird families flew away to africa than those that flew away to asia?", "qid": "735", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and the number of bird families that flew away to Asia.\n\nFirst, we add the number of bird families that flew away to both Asia and Africa: 35 + 62 = 97.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Asia from the total number of bird families that flew away: 97 - 35 = 62.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away to Asia from the total number of bird families that flew away and divide the result by 2 to find the difference between the two groups: (62 - 35) / 2 = 37.\n\nThe answer is 37.", "answer": 27.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/735.png"}
