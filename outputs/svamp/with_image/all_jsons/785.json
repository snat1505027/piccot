{"question": "Faye was placing her pencils into rows with 5 pencils in each row. If she had 35 pencils and 7 crayons. How many rows could she make?", "qid": "785", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of rows Faye can make with the given number of pencils and crayons.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of pencils Faye can place in each row. Since she has 35 pencils and wants to place them into 5 rows, we can calculate the number of pencils per row by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of rows:\n\n35 pencils \u00f7 5 rows = 7 pencils per row\n\nNext, we need to find the number of crayons Faye has. The image does not provide the number of crayons, so we cannot include them in our calculation.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of pencils and crayons Faye has by adding the number of pencils per row to the number of crayons:\n\n7 pencils per row \u00d7 5 rows = 35 pencils\n\n35 pencils + 7 crayons = 42 writing instruments\n\nSince Faye has 42 writing instruments and wants to place them into rows, we can calculate the number of rows she can make by dividing the total number of writing instruments by the number of pencils per row:\n\n42 writing instruments \u00f7 7 pencils per row = 6 rows\n\nThe answer is 6 rows.", "answer": 7.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/785.png"}
