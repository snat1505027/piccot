{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet. How deep was the water?", "qid": "13", "response": "First, we need to find the height of Dean. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, so we can calculate his height by adding 4 feet to Ron's height:\n\nRon's height + 4 feet = Dean's height\n13 feet + 4 feet = 17 feet\n\nNext, we know that the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. So, we can calculate the depth of the water by multiplying 15 by Dean's height:\n\n15 x 17 feet = 255 feet\n\nThe answer is 255 feet.", "answer": 255.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/13.png"}
