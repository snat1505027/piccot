{"question": "Frank had 33 pieces of candy. He lost 24 of them. If he put the remaining pieces into bags with 9 pieces in each bag. How many bags would he have?", "qid": "522", "response": "First, we need to find the number of pieces Frank has left after losing 24 pieces. We can do this by subtracting 24 from 33:\n\n33 - 24 = 9\n\nNext, we need to find the number of bags Frank would have if he puts 9 pieces in each bag. We can do this by dividing the number of pieces by the number of pieces per bag:\n\n9 / 9 = 1\n\nSo, Frank would have 1 bag with 9 pieces of candy in it.\n\nThe answer is 1 bag with 9 pieces of candy.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/522.png"}
