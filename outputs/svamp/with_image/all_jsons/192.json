How many more chairs will they have to buy?", "qid": "192", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chairs are currently available and how many more chairs are needed.\n\nIn the image, there are 4 sets of tables, each with 3 chairs. So, the total number of chairs currently available is 4 x 3 = 12.\n\nSince 14 people will attend the party, we need to find out how many more chairs are needed. We can do this by subtracting the current number of chairs from the total number of people attending: 14 - 12 = 2.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/192.png"}
