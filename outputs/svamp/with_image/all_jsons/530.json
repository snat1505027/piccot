{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 102 classrooms. There are 11 students in the school and 99 seats on each school bus. If 8 students do n't want to go for the trip. How many students are going on the trip?", "qid": "530", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of students who do not want to go on the trip. We can do this by multiplying the number of classrooms by the number of students who do not want to go on the trip.\n\n102 classrooms \\* 8 students = 816 students who do not want to go on the trip\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of students who do not want to go on the trip from the total number of students in the school.\n\n11 students + 816 students = 827 students\n\nFinally, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each school bus to find the number of students who can go on the trip.\n\n827 students / 99 seats per bus = 8.38 students per bus\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n8.38 students per bus rounded up to the nearest whole number = 9 students per bus\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9 students going on the trip.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/530.png"}
