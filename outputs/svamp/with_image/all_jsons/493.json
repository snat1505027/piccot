{"question": "Paul had 51 books and 106 pens. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 82 books and 14 pens left. How many pens did he sell in the garage sale?", "qid": "493", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pens Paul sold in the garage sale. We can start by using the information that he had 51 books and 106 pens initially. After the garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens left.\n\nLet's represent the number of books and pens using variables:\n\nLet B represent the number of books.\nLet P represent the number of pens.\n\nWe know that initially, B = 51 and P = 106.\nAfter the garage sale, B = 82 and P = 14.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\nB + P - B - P = 51 + 106 - 82 - 14\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n2P - 2P = 51 - 82\n\nSolving for P:\n\n2P = 133\n\nP = 66.5\n\nHowever, we need to find the whole number of pens sold, so we can round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nP = 67\n\nThe answer is 67.", "answer": 92.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/493.png"}
