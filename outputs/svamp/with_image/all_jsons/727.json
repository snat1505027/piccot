{"question": "There were 13 roses in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden which had a total of 12 roses. There are now 21 roses in the vase. How many roses are left in the garden?", "qid": "727", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of roses in the vase after Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden. We know that there were 13 roses in the vase initially, and Jessica cut 12 roses from her garden, so the total number of roses in the vase is 13 + 12 = 25 roses.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of roses left in the garden. We know that Jessica cut 12 roses from her garden, so the number of roses left in the garden is 12 - 12 = 0 roses.\n\nThe answer is 0 roses left in the garden.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/727.png"}
