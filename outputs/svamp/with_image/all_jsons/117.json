{"question": "15 campers went rowing in the morning. Some more campers went rowing in the afternoon. If a total of 32 campers went rowing that day. How many campers went rowing in the afternoon?", "qid": "117", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon. Let's call this number x.\n\nWe know that 15 campers went rowing in the morning, so the total number of campers who went rowing in the morning and afternoon is 15 + x.\n\nWe also know that the total number of campers who went rowing that day is 32. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n15 + x = 32\n\nNow we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 32 - 15\n\nx = 17\n\nSo, 17 campers went rowing in the afternoon.\n\nThe answer is 17.", "answer": 17.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/117.png"}
