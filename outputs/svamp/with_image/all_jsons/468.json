Number of friends: 9\n2. Number of invitations per package: 3\n3. Number of packages: 2\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of invitations in the 2 packages:\n2 packages \u00d7 3 invitations per package = 6 invitations\n\nSince Carol wants to invite 9 friends, she will need 9 invitations in total. However, she only has 6 invitations from the 2 packages. Therefore, she will need to buy 9 - 6 = 3 extra invitations.\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/468.png"}
