{"question": "Some children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 2 more children got on the bus. Then there were 41 children altogether on the bus. How many children were riding on the bus before the bus stop?", "qid": "786", "response": "Let's start by analyzing the image. The image shows a bus with a total of 41 children on it. We know that 2 children got on the bus at the bus stop, so we can deduce that the initial number of children on the bus was less than 41.\n\nLet's denote the initial number of children as x. The equation we can use is:\n\nx + 2 = 41\n\nNow, we can solve this equation to find the initial number of children:\n\nx + 2 = 41\nx = 41 - 2\nx = 39\n\nSo, there were 39 children on the bus before the bus stop.\n\nThe answer is 39.", "answer": 39.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/786.png"}
