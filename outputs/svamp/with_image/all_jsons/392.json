How many bottle caps did danny have at first?", "qid": "392", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bottle caps Danny had at first. We know that he found 29 bottle caps at the park, and now he has 42 bottle caps in his collection. We can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\n29 + 42 = x (the number of bottle caps Danny had at first)\n\nNow we need to solve the equation:\n\n61 = x - 29\n\n61 - 29 = x\n\n32 = x\n\nThe answer is 32.", "answer": 13.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/392.png"}
