{"question": "There are 65 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches. How many peaches are in each basket?", "qid": "529", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of peaches in each basket. We can do this by adding the number of red peaches and green peaches in each basket.\n\nIn each basket, there are 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches. So, the total number of peaches in each basket is 7 + 3 = 10.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of baskets. We can do this by multiplying the number of peaches per basket by the number of baskets.\n\nTotal number of peaches = 10 (peaches per basket) \\* 65 (baskets)\n\nTotal number of peaches = 10 \\* 65 = 650\n\nThe answer is 650.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/529.png"}
