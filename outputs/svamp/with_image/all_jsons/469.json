{"question": "Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?", "qid": "469", "response": "First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 39 to Zachary's 15 push-ups to find out how many push-ups David did:\n\n15 + 39 = 54\n\nNext, we need to find out how many push-ups John did. We know that John did 9 push-ups less than David, so we can subtract 9 from David's 54 push-ups to find out how many push-ups John did:\n\n54 - 9 = 45\n\nNow we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. We can subtract John's 45 push-ups from Zachary's 15 push-ups:\n\n15 - 45 = -30\n\nSince the answer is negative, it means that John did more push-ups than Zachary.\n\nThe answer is -30.", "answer": 30.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/469.png"}
