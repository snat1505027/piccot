{"question": "We ordered 9 pizzas. Each pizza has 10 slices. If there are 2 of us. How many slices of pizza does each of us get if distributed equally?", "qid": "709", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of slices in the 9 pizzas. We can do this by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 9 pizzas x 10 slices per pizza = 90 slices.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of slices for the two people. Since there are two people, we can multiply the total number of slices by 2 to find the total number of slices for both people: 90 slices x 2 = 180 slices.\n\nFinally, we can divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find the number of slices each person gets: 180 slices \u00f7 2 people = 90 slices per person.\n\nThe answer is 90 slices per person.", "answer": 45.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/709.png"}
