After deleting some, he had 14 apps left.\n\nTo find out how many more apps he deleted than he added, we need to subtract the number of apps he added from the number of apps he had left.\n\n14 apps left - 71 apps added = -57 apps\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Dave deleted more apps than he added. The answer is -57 apps.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/184.png"}
