{"question": "Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 27 marbles. How many marbles did Doug have initially?", "qid": "119", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of marbles that Doug had. Let's start by using the information that Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. We can represent this as:\n\nEd's marbles - Doug's marbles = 5\n\nNext, we know that Doug lost 3 marbles at the playground. So, we can add 3 to the difference between Ed's and Doug's marbles:\n\nEd's marbles - Doug's marbles = 5 + 3\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of 27 for Ed's marbles in the equation:\n\n27 - Doug's marbles = 5 + 3\n\nTo solve for Doug's marbles, we can isolate the variable:\n\nDoug's marbles = 27 - 5 - 3\n\nDoug's marbles = 27 - 8\n\nDoug's marbles = 19\n\nThe answer is 19.", "answer": 22.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/119.png"}
