{"question": "Paul got a box of 457 erasers and 617 crayons for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 523 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?", "qid": "19", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of crayons and erasers Paul had at the beginning and the number of crayons he had left at the end of the school year.\n\nAt the beginning, Paul had 457 erasers and 617 crayons, making a total of 457 + 617 = 1074.\n\nAt the end of the school year, Paul had 523 crayons left, which means he had 1074 - 523 = 551 crayons at the beginning.\n\nSince Paul didn't lose any erasers, he still had 457 erasers at the end of the school year.\n\nThe difference between the number of crayons and erasers Paul had at the beginning and the end of the school year is 551 - 457 = 94.\n\nThe answer is 94.", "answer": 66.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/19.png"}
