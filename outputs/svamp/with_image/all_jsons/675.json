We can do this by dividing the total number of pages in the book by the number of days it took Frank to finish the book.\n\n193 pages in the book \u00f7 660 days = <<193/660=0.3>>0.3 pages per day\n\nSince the answer is not an integer, we need to round it to the nearest whole number.\n\n0.3 pages per day rounded to the nearest whole number is 1 chapter per day.\n\nThe answer is 1 chapter per day.", "answer": 44.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/675.png"}
