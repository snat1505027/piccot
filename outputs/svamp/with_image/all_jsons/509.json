How much did his dad's strawberries weigh?", "qid": "509", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of his dad's strawberries. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\n1. Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds.\n2. Together, their strawberries weighed 37 pounds.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the problem:\n\nMarco's strawberries + his dad's strawberries = Total strawberries\n\n15 + x = 37\n\nNow, we need to solve for x, which represents his dad's strawberries. To do this, we can subtract 15 from 37:\n\nx = 37 - 15\n\nx = 22\n\nThe answer is 22 pounds.", "answer": 22.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/509.png"}
