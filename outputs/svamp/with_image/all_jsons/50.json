We can do this by subtracting the number of alligators hiding from the total number of alligators.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of alligators. The image shows that there are 97 alligators in the cage.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of alligators hiding. The image shows that 40 alligators were hiding.\n\nNow, we can find the number of alligators not hiding by subtracting the number of alligators hiding from the total number of alligators. 97 - 40 = 57.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 57.", "answer": 57.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/50.png"}
