{"question": "David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups. How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?", "qid": "512", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of push-ups that both David and Zachary did together.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of push-ups Zachary did. We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can find Zachary's push-ups by subtracting 56 from David's push-ups:\n\n38 push-ups - 56 = 18 push-ups\n\nNow that we have Zachary's push-ups, we can find the total number of push-ups both David and Zachary did together by adding their push-ups:\n\n38 push-ups + 18 push-ups = 56 push-ups\n\nThe answer is 56 push-ups.", "answer": 20.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/512.png"}
