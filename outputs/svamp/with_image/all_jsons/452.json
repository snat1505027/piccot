{"question": "A waiter had 8 customers. After some left he still had 5 customers. Then he got 99 new customers. How many customers left?", "qid": "452", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers who left and the number of customers the waiter currently has.\n\n1. The waiter had 8 customers initially.\n2. Some customers left, leaving the waiter with 5 customers.\n3. The waiter then got 99 new customers.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of customers who left. To do this, we can subtract the number of customers the waiter currently has (5) from the initial number of customers (8).\n\n5 - 8 = -3\n\nSince the number of customers who left is negative, we can conclude that some customers did not leave. Therefore, the number of customers who left is 0.\n\nThe waiter currently has 5 customers + 99 new customers = 104 customers.\n\nThe answer is 104.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/452.png"}
