{"question": "Jake has 13 more apples and 17 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples. How many apples does Jake have?", "qid": "302", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of apples and peaches that Steven has. Steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples, so the total is 8 + 12 = 20.\n\nNext, we need to find the difference between the total number of apples and peaches that Steven has and the number of apples and peaches that Jake has. Jake has 13 more apples and 17 fewer peaches than Steven. So, the difference in apples is 13, and the difference in peaches is 17.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of apples that Jake has by adding the difference in apples to Steven's total number of apples. 20 (Steven's total) + 13 (difference in apples) = 33.\n\nThe answer is 33.", "answer": 25.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/302.png"}
