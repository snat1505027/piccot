{"question": "Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all. How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?", "qid": "252", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the floors that need to be covered with carpet.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of each room. The length of each room is 19 feet, and the width is 18 feet. To find the area of each room, we multiply these two values: 19 feet x 18 feet = 362 square feet.\n\nNext, we need to find the total area of all the rooms. Since there are 20 rooms, we multiply the area of each room by the number of rooms: 362 square feet x 20 rooms = 7240 square feet.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the total area from square feet to square yards. To do this, we divide the total area by 9, since there are 9 square feet in a square yard: 7240 square feet \u00f7 9 = 804.44 square yards.\n\nThe answer is 804.44 square yards.", "answer": 6840.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/252.png"}
