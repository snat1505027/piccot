{"question": "Jerry had 3 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed some of the old ones. If there are 6 action figures on his shelf now. How many action figures did he remove from the shelf?", "qid": "24", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. We know that Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf initially, and later he added 4 more action figures. We also know that he removed some of the old ones, but we don't know how many.\n\nLet's start by using the information that Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf initially. We can represent this as 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nNext, we know that Jerry removed some of the old ones, but we don't know how many. We can represent this as 7 - x = 6, where x is the number of action figures removed.\n\nNow we have an equation: 3 + 4 = 7 - x.\n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 4 = 7 - x.\n\nThen, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation: 7 = 7 - x + 3.\n\nFinally, we can simplify the equation by subtracting 7 from both sides: x = -3.\n\nThe answer is -3.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/24.png"}
