If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?", "qid": "686", "response": "The Razorback t-shirt shop made $87 from each t-shirt sold. They sold a total of 95 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas tech game. We can do this by subtracting the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold.\n\n95 (total) - 47 (Arkansas game) = 48 (Texas tech game)\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money the shop made from selling t-shirts during the Texas tech game. We can do this by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas tech game by the amount of money made per t-shirt.\n\n48 (t-shirts sold) x $87 (per t-shirt) = $<<48*87=4,084>>4,084\n\nThe answer is $4,084.", "answer": 8265.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/686.png"}
