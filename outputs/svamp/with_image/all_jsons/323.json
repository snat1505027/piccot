{"question": "David did 44 push-ups in gym class today. David did 9 more push-ups than Zachary. How many push-ups did Zachary do?", "qid": "323", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that David did 44 push-ups and 9 more push-ups than Zachary. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n44 + 9 = Total push-ups Zachary did\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of push-ups Zachary did. To do this, we can subtract 44 from the equation:\n\n9 = Total push-ups Zachary did - 44\n\nNow, we can solve for the total number of push-ups Zachary did:\n\n9 = 44 - Total push-ups Zachary did\n\nTo find the total number of push-ups Zachary did, we can add 44 to the equation:\n\n44 = 9 + Total push-ups Zachary did\n\nNow, we can solve for the total number of push-ups Zachary did:\n\n44 = 9 + Total push-ups Zachary did\n\n44 - 9 = Total push-ups Zachary did\n\n35 = Total push-ups Zachary did\n\nThe answer is 35.", "answer": 35.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/323.png"}
