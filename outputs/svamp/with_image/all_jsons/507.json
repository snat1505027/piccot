{"question": "Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 11 pounds. If together their strawberries weighed 30 pounds. How much did Marco's strawberries weigh?", "qid": "507", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of Marco's strawberries. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\n1. Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 11 pounds.\n2. Together, their strawberries weighed 30 pounds.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the problem:\n\nMarco's dad's strawberries + Marco's strawberries = Total strawberries\n\n11 + Marco's strawberries = 30\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation. To do this, we can subtract 11 from 30:\n\n30 - 11 = 19\n\nSince the answer is not in pounds, we need to convert it to pounds. To convert 19 to pounds, we can multiply it by 1:\n\n19 x 1 = 19\n\nThe answer is 19 pounds.", "answer": 19.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/507.png"}
