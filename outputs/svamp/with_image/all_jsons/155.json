Since each package has 2 invitations, we can calculate the total number of invitations needed by multiplying the number of friends by the number of invitations per package.\n\n10 friends \\* 2 invitations per package = <<10*2=20>>20 invitations\n\nSince Carol needs to send 20 invitations, she needs to buy 20 packs of invitations.\n\nThe answer is 20 packs.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/155.png"}
