We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\nFirst, we know that the mailman has to give 9 pieces of junk mail to each house in each block. Next, we know that there are 20 houses in a block.\n\nTo find the number of pieces of junk mail in each block, we can divide the number of houses by the number of pieces of junk mail per house.\n\n20 houses \u00f7 9 pieces of junk mail per house = 2.2222...\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a piece of junk mail, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n2.2222... \u2248 2 (rounded up)\n\nThe answer is 2 pieces of junk mail in each block.", "answer": 180.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/137.png"}
