{"question": "There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?", "qid": "112", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many orchids were cut by Jessica. Let's start by looking at the given information:\n\n1. There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase initially.\n2. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.\n3. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase.\n\nWe can represent the initial state of the vase with the following equation:\n\n16 roses + 3 orchids = x (total number of flowers)\n\nSince Jessica cut some more roses and orchids, we can represent the final state of the vase with the following equation:\n\n7 orchids + 13 roses = y (total number of flowers)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of orchids that were cut by Jessica. To do this, we can subtract the number of orchids in the final state (7) from the initial state (3), which gives us:\n\n3 orchids - 7 orchids = -4 orchids\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of orchids, we can conclude that Jessica did not cut any orchids. The answer is 0 orchids.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/112.png"}
