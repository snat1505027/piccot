{"question": "For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks. If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails. How many nails does John need for the house wall?", "qid": "285", "response": "To find the total number of nails needed for the house wall, we need to find the number of large planks and the number of small planks.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that there are 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks of wood.\n\nTo find the total number of nails needed for the large planks, we multiply the number of large planks by the number of nails needed per large plank: 12 large planks x 15 nails per large plank = 180 nails.\n\nTo find the total number of nails needed for the small planks, we multiply the number of small planks by the number of nails needed per small plank: 10 small planks x 5 nails per small plank = 50 nails.\n\nNow, we add the total number of nails needed for the large planks and the small planks to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall: 180 nails + 50 nails = 230 nails.\n\nThe answer is 230 nails.", "answer": 20.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/285.png"}
