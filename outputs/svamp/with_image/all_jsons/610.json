{"question": "There are 11 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 18 green peaches. How many peaches are in the baskets altogether?", "qid": "610", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of peaches in the baskets. We can do this by adding the number of red peaches and green peaches in each basket.\n\n11 baskets of peaches have 10 red peaches each, so the total number of red peaches is 10 \\* 11 = 110.\n\n11 baskets of peaches have 18 green peaches each, so the total number of green peaches is 18 \\* 11 = 198.\n\nTo find the total number of peaches, we add the number of red peaches and green peaches: 110 + 198 = 308.\n\nThe answer is 308.", "answer": 308.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/610.png"}
