{"question": "Rachel has 52 apple trees. She picked 2 apples from 1 of her trees. Now the tree has 7 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?", "qid": "708", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of apples on the tree. Let's start by using the information provided in the image.\n\nRachel has 52 apple trees. She picked 2 apples from 1 of her trees. Now the tree has 7 apples still on it.\n\nWe can represent this information in the form of an equation:\n\n52 - 2 = 7\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation to find the initial number of apples on the tree.\n\n52 - 2 = 7\n50 = 7\n\nWe can see that 50 is not equal to 7, so there is an error in the equation. Let's try again by using the information provided in the image.\n\nRachel has 52 apple trees. She picked 2 apples from 1 of her trees.
