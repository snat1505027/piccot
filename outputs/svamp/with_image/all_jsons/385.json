Mary has already added 11 cups of flour.\n\nTo find the difference between the number of cups of sugar and the number of cups of flour, we need to subtract the number of cups of flour Mary has already added from the total number of cups of flour needed.\n\n14 cups of flour - 11 cups of flour = 3 cups of flour\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of cups of sugar and the number of cups of flour that Mary needs to add.\n\n5 cups of sugar - 3 cups of flour = 2 cups of sugar\n\nThe answer is 2 cups of sugar.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/385.png"}
