We know that together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. So, we can find the weight of dad's strawberries by subtracting the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight.\n\n47 pounds - 30 pounds = 17 pounds\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the weight of Marco's strawberries and dad's strawberries. To do this, we can subtract the weight of dad's strawberries from the weight of Marco's strawberries.\n\n30 pounds - 17 pounds = 13 pounds\n\nThe answer is 13 pounds.", "answer": 13.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/852.png"}
