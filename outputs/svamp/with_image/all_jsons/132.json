{"question": "22 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 40 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 2 children altogether on the bus. How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?", "qid": "132", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of children on the bus before and after the bus stop.\n\nFirst, we know that there were 22 children on the bus before the bus stop.\n\nNext, we know that 40 children got on the bus at the bus stop, so the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop is 22 + 40 = 62.\n\nFinally, we know that there are 2 children on the bus after the bus stop.\n\nTo find the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop, we need to subtract the number of children on the bus after the bus stop from the total number of children on the bus before and after the bus stop.\n\n22 + 40 - 2 = 60 - 2 = 58\n\nThe answer is 58.", "answer": 60.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/132.png"}
