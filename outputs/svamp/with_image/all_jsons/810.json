{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?", "qid": "810", "response": "The image shows that Mary has already added 8 cups of flour. To determine how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we need to subtract the number of cups of flour she has already added from the total number of cups of flour required in the recipe.\n\nThe recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. Since Mary has already added 8 cups of flour, she needs to add 6 cups of flour (6 - 8 = -2) to reach the required amount. However, since we cannot have a negative number of cups of flour, we need to add 8 more cups of flour to the recipe.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 21.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/810.png"}
