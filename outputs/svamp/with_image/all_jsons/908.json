{"question": "Robin cut off 20 inches of his hair. If his hair is now 10 inches long. How long was his hair before he cut?", "qid": "908", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. We know that Robin cut off 20 inches of his hair, and his hair is now 10 inches long. We can use this information to find the length of his hair before he cut it.\n\nFirst, we need to find the difference between the initial length of his hair and the length after he cut it. The difference is 20 inches (cut off) - 10 inches (current length) = 10 inches.\n\nNext, we need to find the initial length of his hair. We can do this by adding the length after cutting to the length after cutting and then subtracting the difference we found earlier. 10 inches (current length) + 10 inches (difference) = 20 inches (initial length).\n\nThe answer is 20 inches.", "answer": 30.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/908.png"}
