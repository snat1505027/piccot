{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 67 classrooms. There are 66 students in each classroom in the school. If there are 6 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?", "qid": "685", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students in the school. We can do this by multiplying the number of classrooms by the number of students per classroom.\n\n67 classrooms x 66 students per classroom = 4,422 students\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of seats required for all the students. We can do this by multiplying the total number of students by the number of seats per bus.\n\n4,422 students x 6 seats per bus = 26,332 seats\n\nSince we need more seats than the total number of seats available on the buses, we cannot take all the students on the trip. We need to find the number of buses required to accommodate the students.\n\nTo do this, we can divide the total number of seats needed by the number of seats per bus.\n\n26,332 seats \u00f7 6 seats per bus = 4,388.67 buses\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of buses.\n\n4,388.67 buses \u2248 4,400 buses\n\nThe answer is 4,400 buses.", "answer": 737.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/685.png"}
