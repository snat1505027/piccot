{"question": "There are 22 different books and 10 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 12 of the books and watched 56 of the movies. How many more books do you still have to read?", "qid": "833", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of books and movies that the person has read.\n\nThe person has read 12 books, so we can add that to the total number of books.\n\nThe person has watched 56 movies, so we can add that to the total number of movies.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of books and movies that the person has not read or watched.\n\nTotal number of books = 22 - 12 = 10\nTotal number of movies = 10 - 56 = -46 (This is negative because the person has watched more movies than there are in the series.)\n\nSince the total number of movies is negative, we cannot find the number of more books to read. The answer is 10.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/833.png"}
