{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height. Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron. If Ron stands at 14 feet. How deep was the water?", "qid": "150", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the depth of the water. We know that the depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height, and Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron. Let's start by finding Dean's height.\n\nDean's height = Ron's height - 8 feet\nDean's height = 14 feet - 8 feet\nDean's height = 6 feet\n\nNow that we have Dean's height, we can find the depth of the water.\n\nDepth of the water = 2 times Dean's height\nDepth of the water = 2 x 6 feet\nDepth of the water = 12 feet\n\nThe answer is 12 feet.", "answer": 12.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/150.png"}
