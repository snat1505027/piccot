{"question": "Faye was placing her pencils and crayons into 16 rows with 6 crayons and 21 pencils in each row. How many crayons does she have?", "qid": "853", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crayons Faye has. We know that she has 16 rows, and each row contains 6 crayons and 21 pencils. We can start by finding the total number of crayons in all the rows.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of crayons in one row. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows (16) by the number of crayons in each row (6).\n\n16 rows \\* 6 crayons/row = 96 crayons\n\nNow that we know the total number of crayons in all the rows, we can find the number of crayons Faye has. We can do this by subtracting the number of pencils in each row from the total number of crayons.\n\n96 crayons - 21 pencils/row = 75 crayons\n\nThe answer is 75 crayons.", "answer": 96.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/853.png"}
