{"question": "The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?", "qid": "950", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the distance the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can start by finding the distance the grasshopper jumped. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, so we can add 39 to that number to find the distance the frog jumped.\n\n19 + 39 = 58\n\nNext, we need to find the distance the mouse jumped. The mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog, so we can subtract 94 from the distance the frog jumped to find the distance the mouse jumped.\n\n58 - 94 = -36\n\nSince the mouse jumped less than the frog, its distance is negative. This means that the mouse actually jumped in the opposite direction, so we can add 36 to the distance the frog jumped to find the total distance the mouse jumped.\n\n58 + 36 = 94\n\nNow we have the total distance the mouse jumped, which is 94 inches. We can use this information to find the distance the frog jumped by subtracting the mouse's distance from the frog's distance.\n\n58 - 94 = -36\n\nSince the frog's distance is greater than the mouse's distance, we can add 36 to the frog's distance to find the total distance the frog jumped.\n\n58 + 36 = 94\n\nThe answer is 94.", "answer": 58.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/950.png"}
