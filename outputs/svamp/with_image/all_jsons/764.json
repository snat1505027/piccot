{"question": "If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet. How far is the end of the cave?", "qid": "764", "response": "To find the end of the cave, we need to subtract the distance they need to travel from the depth of the cave.\n\n919 feet - 1307 feet = -388 feet\n\nSince the answer is negative, it means the end of the cave is not at the depth of 919 feet. We need to find the actual depth of the cave.\n\nTo find the actual depth of the cave, we can add the distance they need to travel to the depth of the cave.\n\n919 feet + 1307 feet = 2226 feet\n\nThe answer is 2226 feet.", "answer": 2226.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/764.png"}
