How many days did he take to finish the book?", "qid": "148", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pages Frank read and then divide it by the number of pages he read per day.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of pages Frank read. We can do this by multiplying the number of pages he read per day by the total number of days he spent reading the book.\n\n8 pages per day \u00d7 total number of days = total number of pages read\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of pages in the book. We can do this by multiplying the number of pages per day by the total number of days it took Frank to finish the book.\n\n8 pages per day \u00d7 total number of days = total number of pages in the book\n\nNow we have the total number of pages Frank read and the total number of pages in the book. We can find the number of days it took Frank to finish the book by dividing the total number of pages in the book by the total number of pages he read.\n\ntotal number of pages in the book \u00f7 total number of pages read = total number of days it took Frank to finish the book\n\nThe answer is 576 pages \u00f7 8 pages per day = 71.5 days.", "answer": 72.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/148.png"}
