We know that together they collected 24 pounds of strawberries, and after Marco lost 9 pounds, they still have 15 pounds of strawberries.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much of the 15 pounds of strawberries belong to Marco's dad. Since the image shows that Marco's strawberries weighed 3 pounds, we can deduce that his dad's strawberries weighed 15 - 3 = 12 pounds.\n\nThe answer is 12 pounds.", "answer": 12.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/356.png"}
