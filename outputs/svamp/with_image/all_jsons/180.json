{"question": "For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?", "qid": "180", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall. We can start by finding the total number of nails needed for the large planks of wood. We know that 13 large planks of wood require 17 pieces of nails each. So, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 13 x 17 = <<13*17=231>>231 nails.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of nails needed for the smaller planks. We know that 8 nails are needed for each smaller plank. So, the total number of nails needed for the smaller planks is 8 x 8 = <<8*8=64>>64 nails.\n\nFinally, we need to add the total number of nails needed for the large and smaller planks to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall. The total number of nails needed is 231 + 64 = <<231+64=395>>395 nails.\n\nThe answer is 395 nails.", "answer": 229.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/180.png"}
