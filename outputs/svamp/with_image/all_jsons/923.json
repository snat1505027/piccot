{"question": "Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. If her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide.

The room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. To find the total length of the room, we multiply the length and width: 4 feet x 20 feet = 80 square feet.\n2. Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. To find the area of the carpet, we multiply the length and width of the carpet: 18 square feet x 18 square feet = 324 square feet.\n3. The total area of the room is 80 square feet. The area of the carpet is 324 square feet. To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs, we subtract the area of the carpet from the total area of the room: 80 square feet - 324 square feet = -244 square feet.\n\nThe answer is -244 square feet.", "answer": 62.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/923.png"}
