{"question": "Edward spent $ 16 to buy 92 books each book costing him the same amount of money. Now he has $ 6. How much did Edward have before he spent his money?", "qid": "626", "response": "To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we need to find the total cost of the books he bought. We can do this by multiplying the number of books by their cost per book.\n\n92 books \\* $16/book = $<<92*16=1532>>1532\n\nSince Edward had $6 left, we can find out how much he had before spending his money by subtracting the amount he had left from the total cost of the books.\n\n$1532 - $6 = $<<1532-6=1526>>1526\n\nThe answer is $1526.", "answer": 22.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/626.png"}
