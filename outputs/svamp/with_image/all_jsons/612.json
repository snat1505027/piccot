We know that a total of 60 campers went rowing that day, and 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon. We can set up an equation to represent the information:\n\nMorning campers + Afternoon campers = Total campers\n\nWe can then solve for the number of campers who went rowing in the morning:\n\nMorning campers + 7 = 60\nMorning campers = 60 - 7\nMorning campers = 53\n\nThe answer is 53.", "answer": 53.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/612.png"}
