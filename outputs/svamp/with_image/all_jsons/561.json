{"question": "2 birds were sitting on the fence. Some more birds came to join them. If there are a total of 6 birds on the fence now. How many more birds had come to sit on the fence?", "qid": "561", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total number of birds on the fence and the initial number of birds on the fence.\n\nIn the image, there are two boxes with the number 2 in one box and the number 6 in the other box. The number 2 represents the initial number of birds on the fence, and the number 6 represents the total number of birds on the fence now.\n\nTo find the difference, we can subtract the initial number of birds (2) from the total number of birds (6).\n\n2 - 6 = -4\n\nSince the result is negative, we need to add the negative number to the initial number to get the correct answer.\n\n2 + (-4) = 6\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/561.png"}
