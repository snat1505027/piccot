{"question": "There are 62 different movies and 19 different books in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 4 of the books and watched 34 of the movies. How many more books do you still have to read?", "qid": "222", "response": "There are 62 movies in the series and 19 books. If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies, you have read 4/19 of the books and watched 34/62 of the movies.\n\nTo find out how many more books you have to read, you need to find the difference between the number of books you have read and the number of books you have left to read. You have read 4/19 of the books, which is 0.2111 (rounded to 4 decimal places). To find the number of books left to read, you need to subtract 0.2111 from 1.\n\n0.2111 + 0.2111 + 0.2111 + 0.2111 = 0.8444 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nSo, you still have to read 1 - 0.8444 = 0.1556 (rounded to 4 decimal places) more books.\n\nThe answer is 0.1556.", "answer": 15.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/222.png"}
