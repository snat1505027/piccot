{"question": "2 birds and 6 storks were sitting on the fence. 3 more birds came to join them. How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?", "qid": "86", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of birds and storks on the fence.\n\nIn the image, there are two birds and six storks on the fence.\n\nWhen three more birds come to join them, the total number of birds becomes 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of birds and storks. The number of storks remains the same, so the difference is simply the number of birds minus the number of storks: 5 - 6 = -1.\n\nHowever, the answer cannot be negative, so we need to add one to the result to make it positive. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/86.png"}
