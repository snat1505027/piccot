{"question": "The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 23 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they made $ 230 by selling t-shirts. How many t-shirts did they sell?", "qid": "261", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of t-shirts sold. We know that the shop made $230 from selling t-shirts during the game. We can use the information from the image to find the number of t-shirts sold.\n\nThe image shows that the shop makes $23 per t-shirt sold. To find the number of t-shirts sold, we can divide the total revenue by the revenue per t-shirt:\n\n$230 / $23 = <<230/23=10.04>>10.04 t-shirts\n\nHowever, the answer is not a whole number, so we need to round it down to the nearest whole number. This gives us:\n\n10 t-shirts\n\nThe answer is 10.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/261.png"}
