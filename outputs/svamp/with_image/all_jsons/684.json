{"question": "Baker made 56 pastries and 124 cakes. If he sold 104 cakes and 29 pastries. How many pastries would baker still have?", "qid": "684", "response": "First, we need to find out how many pastries Baker sold. We know that he sold 104 cakes and 29 pastries, so we can add these numbers together to get the total number of pastries sold:\n\n104 cakes + 29 pastries = 133 pastries\n\nNext, we need to subtract the total number of pastries sold from the total number of pastries Baker made to find out how many pastries he still has:\n\n56 pastries - 133 pastries = -77 pastries\n\nSince the number of pastries Baker still has is negative, it means he has none left. The answer is 0 pastries.", "answer": 27.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/684.png"}
