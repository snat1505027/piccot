First, we need to find the total number of seats on all school buses.\n\n95 school buses x 118 seats per bus = 11,270 seats\n\n2. Next, we divide the total number of seats by the number of seats per bus to find the total number of students in the school.\n\n11,270 seats \u00f7 118 seats per bus = 95 students per bus\n\n3. Now, we multiply the number of students per bus by the total number of buses to find the total number of students in the school.\n\n95 students per bus x 95 buses = 9,175 students\n\nThe answer is 9,175 students.", "answer": 11210.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/573.png"}
