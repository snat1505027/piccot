{"question": "Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds. If together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds. How much more did his dad's strawberries weigh than his?", "qid": "879", "response": "First, we need to find the total weight of both strawberries. We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds, and together they weighed 26 pounds. So, we can calculate the total weight by adding the weight of Marco's strawberries to the weight of his dad's strawberries.\n\n10 + 26 = 36\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of his dad's strawberries. We can do this by subtracting the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight.\n\n36 - 10 = 26\n\nSince the total weight of both strawberries was 26 pounds, and Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds, his dad's strawberries weighed 26 - 10 = 16 pounds.\n\nThe answer is 16 pounds.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/879.png"}
