{"question": "Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 11 friends. How many crackers did each person eat?", "qid": "649", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of crackers and cakes that Matthew gave to his friends. We can do this by multiplying the number of friends by the number of crackers and cakes each friend received.\n\n22 crackers \\* 11 friends = 242 crackers\n34 cakes \\* 11 friends = 364 cakes\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of crackers and cakes that Matthew had. We can do this by adding the number of crackers and cakes he had to the total number of crackers and cakes he gave to his friends.\n\n22 crackers + 34 cakes = 56\n242 crackers + 364 cakes = 606\n\nSince Matthew had 56 crackers and 606 crackers in total, we can find the number of crackers each person ate by dividing the total number of crackers by the number of friends.\n\n606 crackers \u00f7 11 friends = 55 crackers each person ate.\n\nThe answer is 55 crackers each person ate.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/649.png"}
