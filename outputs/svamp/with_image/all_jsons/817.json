{"question": "Baker's friend bought 137 cakes from him. If he had made 169 cakes initially. How many cakes would baker still have?", "qid": "817", "response": "First, we need to find the number of cakes the baker initially made. We know that his friend bought 137 cakes, so we can set up the equation:\n\n169 (initially made) - 137 (bought) = X (still has)\n\nNow, we need to solve for X. To do this, we can add 137 to 169:\n\n169 + 137 = 306\n\nThe answer is 306.", "answer": 32.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/817.png"}
