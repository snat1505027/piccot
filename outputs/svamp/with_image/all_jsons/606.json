How many hours does he spend on learning english and chinese each day?", "qid": "606", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese each day.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of hours Ryan spends on learning English. We know that he spends 4 hours per day on learning English. To find the total number of hours, we multiply the number of days (86) by the number of hours per day (4):\n\n4 (hours per day) \\* 86 (days) = 344 hours\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of hours Ryan spends on learning Chinese. We know that he spends 6 hours per day on learning Chinese. To find the total number of hours, we multiply the number of days (86) by the number of hours per day (6):\n\n6 (hours per day) \\* 86 (days) = 536 hours\n\nNow, we can add the total number of hours spent on learning English and Chinese to find the total number of hours Ryan spends on learning each day:\n\n344 (hours per day) + 536 (hours per day) = 880 hours\n\nThe answer is 880 hours.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/606.png"}
