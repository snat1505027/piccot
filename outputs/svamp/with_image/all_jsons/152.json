We know that 10 seeds were planted in each flower bed, and there are 45 flowerbeds.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of seeds in each flower bed. To do this, we multiply the number of seeds per flower bed by the number of flower beds:\n\n10 seeds per flower bed \\* 45 flower beds = 450 seeds per flower bed\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of seeds planted. To do this, we multiply the total number of seeds per flower bed by the total number of flower beds:\n\n450 seeds per flower bed \\* 45 flower beds = 20750 seeds planted\n\nThe answer is 20750.", "answer": 450.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/152.png"}
