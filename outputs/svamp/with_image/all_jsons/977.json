How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?", "qid": "977", "response": "Let's start by finding the number of push-ups Zachary did. We know that Zachary did 58 push-ups.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of crunches Zachary did. We know that Zachary did 33 crunches.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did. If Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, the difference is 58 - 33 = 25.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of push-ups more than crunches Zachary did. We know that David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary. So, the difference between the number of push-ups Zachary did and the number of push-ups David did is 36 - 25 = 11.\n\nThe answer is 11.", "answer": 25.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/977.png"}
