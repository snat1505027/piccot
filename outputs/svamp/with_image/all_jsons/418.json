{"question": "You have 104 dollars. How many packs of dvds can you buy if each pack costs 26 dollars?", "qid": "418", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many packs of dvds you can buy with 104 dollars if each pack costs 26 dollars.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total cost of each pack of dvds:\n26 dollars per pack x number of packs = total cost\n\nNext, we need to find out how many packs of dvds you can buy with 104 dollars. To do this, we can set up an equation:\n104 dollars - total cost = number of packs\n\nNow, we can solve the equation for the number of packs:\n104 dollars - (26 dollars per pack x number of packs) = number of packs\n\nFinally, we can simplify the equation and solve for the number of packs:\n104 dollars - 26 dollars per pack x number of packs = number of packs\n\nThe answer is 4 packs.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/418.png"}
