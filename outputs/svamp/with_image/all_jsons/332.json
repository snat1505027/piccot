We can do this by dividing the total number of pages in the book by the number of days it took Frank to finish the book.\n\nThe book has 2 chapters, each with 405 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is 2 x 405 = 810 pages.\n\nFrank took 664 days to finish the book.\n\nPages per day = Total number of pages in the book / Number of days it took Frank to finish the book\nPages per day = 810 / 664\nPages per day = 1.22\n\nThe answer is 1.22 chapters per day.", "answer": 332.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/332.png"}
