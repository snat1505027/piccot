{"question": "Bobby ate 17 pieces of candy. Then he ate 15 more. If he initially had 36 pieces of candy. How many pieces of candy does he still have left?", "qid": "974", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy Bobby ate. We can do this by adding the initial number of candies (36) and the additional candies he ate (15).\n\n36 + 15 = 51\n\nNext, we need to find the number of candies Bobby still has left. We can do this by subtracting the total number of candies he ate (51) from the initial number of candies he had (36).\n\n36 - 51 = -15\n\nSince the answer is negative, it means Bobby has fewer candies left than he initially had. The answer is -15.", "answer": 4.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/974.png"}
