So, the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50 chairs.\n\nThe total number of tables is 5 sets of tables, which is 5 x 5 = 25 tables.\n\nThe difference between the number of chairs and tables is 50 chairs - 25 tables = 25 chairs.\n\nThe answer is 25 chairs.", "answer": 45.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/888.png"}
