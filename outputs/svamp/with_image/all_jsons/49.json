{"question": "Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?", "qid": "49", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards that Nell has left.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of cards Nell had before giving some to Jeff. We can do this by adding the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she had: 309 + 356 = 665.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of cards Nell has left after giving some to Jeff. We can do this by adding the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she has left: 415 + 415 = 830.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards by subtracting the number of Ace cards from the total number of cards Nell has left: 830 - 356 = 474.\n\nThe answer is 474.", "answer": 266.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/49.png"}
