{"question": "Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 of the old ones. If there are 10 action figures on his shelf now. How many action figures did he have initially on the shelf?", "qid": "728", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of action figures on the shelf. Let's call that number x.\n\n1. Jerry had x action figures on the shelf initially.\n2. He added 2 more action figures, so the total number of action figures became x + 2.\n3. He removed 7 action figures, so the total number of action figures became x + 2 - 7.\n4. The final number of action figures on the shelf is 10.\n\nNow we can set up an equation to represent the problem:\nx + 2 - 7 = 10\n\nSolving the equation, we get:\nx = 10 - 2 + 7\nx = 10 + 5\nx = 15\n\nSo, Jerry had 15 action figures on the shelf initially.\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 15.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/728.png"}
