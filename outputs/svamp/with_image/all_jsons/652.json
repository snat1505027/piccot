{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 17 classrooms. There are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school. If all buses are full. How many seats are in each bus?", "qid": "652", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of seats in all the buses. We can do this by multiplying the number of buses by the number of seats in each bus.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of seats in each bus. We can do this by dividing the total number of seats by the total number of buses.\n\nTotal number of seats = 92 students\nTotal number of buses = 46\n\nNumber of seats in each bus = Total number of seats / Total number of buses\nNumber of seats in each bus = 92 / 46\nNumber of seats in each bus = 2\n\nNow that we know the number of seats in each bus, we can find the total number of seats in all the buses by multiplying the number of buses by the number of seats in each bus.\n\nTotal number of seats in all buses = Number of buses x Number of seats in each bus\nTotal number of seats in all buses = 46 x 2\nTotal number of seats in all buses = 92\n\nThe answer is 92.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/652.png"}
