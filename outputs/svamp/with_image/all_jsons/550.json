{"question": "Robin has some packages of gum. There are 7 pieces in each package. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. In all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41. How many packages does Robin have?", "qid": "550", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of packages Robin has. We know that Robin has 41 pieces of gum in total, and each package contains 7 pieces. We can use the following equation to find the number of packages:\n\n41 (total pieces) = 7 (pieces per package) \u00d7 number of packages\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of extra pieces Robin has. We know that Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. We can add this to the total number of pieces to get the total number of pieces in each package:\n\n41 (total pieces) + 6 (extra pieces) = 7 (pieces per package) \u00d7 number of packages\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of packages:\n\n41 + 6 = 7 \u00d7 number of packages\n\n47 = 7 \u00d7 number of packages\n\nTo find the number of packages, we can divide both sides by 7:\n\n47 \u00f7 7 = number of packages\n\n6.7142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857", "answer": 5.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/550.png"}
