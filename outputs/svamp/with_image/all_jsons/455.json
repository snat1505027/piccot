We have 4 birds and 46 storks, so the total number of birds is 46.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of birds that were already on the fence. We know that 4 birds were already on the fence, so the number of birds that came to join them is 6.\n\nFinally, we need to add the number of birds that came to join to the total number of birds to find the current number of birds on the fence. The current number of birds on the fence is 46 + 6 = 52.\n\nThe answer is 52.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/455.png"}
