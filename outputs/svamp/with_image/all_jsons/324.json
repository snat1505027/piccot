{"question": "Edward spent $ 6 to buy books and $ 16 to buy pens. Now he has $ 19. How much did Edward have before he spent his money?", "qid": "324", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Edward had before he spent his money. We can do this by adding the amount he spent on books and pens to the amount he has left after spending the money.\n\nFirst, we need to find the amount Edward spent on books. We know that he spent $6 on books, so we can write that down as 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the amount Edward spent on pens. We know that he spent $16 on pens, so we can write that down as 16.\n\nNow, we can add the amounts Edward spent on books and pens to find the total amount he spent: 6 + 16 = 22.\n\nFinally, we can subtract the total amount Edward spent from the amount he has left to find the amount he had before he spent his money: 19 - 22 = -3.\n\nThe answer is -3.", "answer": 41.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/324.png"}
