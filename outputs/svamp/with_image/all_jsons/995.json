{"question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have?", "qid": "995", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of flower beds that Paige and her mom planted. We know that they planted 36 seeds in total and put 12 seeds in each flower bed. We can use the following equation to find the number of flower beds:\n\n36 seeds / 12 seeds per flower bed = Number of flower beds\n\nFirst, we need to multiply the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per flower bed:\n\n36 seeds \\* 12 seeds per flower bed = 432 seeds\n\nNext, we can divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per flower bed to find the number of flower beds:\n\n432 seeds / 12 seeds per flower bed = 36 flower beds\n\nThe answer is 36 flower beds.", "answer": 3.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/995.png"}
