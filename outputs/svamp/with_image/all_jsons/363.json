The problem states that Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond, but stray cats ate them. Now, she has 2 left. The goal is to find out how many goldfish disappeared.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total number of goldfish and catfish that were initially raised. We can do this by adding the number of goldfish and catfish: 16 + 71 = 87.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many goldfish were eaten by the stray cats. We can do this by subtracting the number of goldfish left (2) from the total number of goldfish initially raised (87). 87 - 2 = 85.\n\nTherefore, 85 goldfish disappeared.\n\nThe answer is 85.", "answer": 14.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/363.png"}
