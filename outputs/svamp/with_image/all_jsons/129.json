{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?", "qid": "129", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary needs to add to reach the required amount of 14 cups of flour.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary has already added. We know that she has already added 7 cups of flour.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cups of flour she needs to add to reach the required amount of 14 cups. We can do this by subtracting the amount of flour she has already added (7 cups) from the required amount (14 cups).\n\n7 cups of flour already added - 14 cups of flour needed = 7 cups of flour needed\n\nSince the answer is in cups, we can conclude that Mary needs to add 7 cups of flour to reach the required amount of 14 cups of flour.\n\nThe answer is 7 cups.", "answer": 7.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/129.png"}
