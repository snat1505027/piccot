We know that they planted 10 seeds in each flower bed and a total of 60 seeds.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of seeds in each flower bed. We can do this by dividing the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per flower bed:\n\n60 seeds \u00f7 10 seeds per flower bed = 6 flower beds\n\nNext, we need to find the number of flower beds that they had. We can do this by multiplying the number of seeds per flower bed by the total number of seeds:\n\n10 seeds per flower bed \u00d7 60 seeds = 600 seeds\n\nSince there are 600 seeds and each seed is in a flower bed, we can conclude that they had 60 flower beds.\n\nThe answer is 60 flower beds.", "answer": 6.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/143.png"}
