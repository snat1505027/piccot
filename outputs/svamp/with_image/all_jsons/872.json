We can do this by adding 30 to the number of marbles Ed had and then subtracting 21 from it.\n\n91 - 21 = 70\n\nNow, we know that Ed had 70 marbles before losing 21 of them. We can find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug by subtracting the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had before losing any.\n\n70 - 30 = 40\n\nThe answer is 40.", "answer": 9.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/872.png"}
