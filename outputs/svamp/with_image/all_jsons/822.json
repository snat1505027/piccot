{"question": "If you have 14 cookies in total and 7 bags having equal number of cookies. How many cookies does each bag have?", "qid": "822", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies in each bag. We know that there are 14 cookies in total and 7 bags, so we can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the total number of cookies and the number of cookies in each bag.\n\nLet's call the number of cookies in each bag 'x'. We can write the proportion as:\n\n14 cookies / 7 bags = x cookies / 1 bag\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply to solve for 'x':\n\n14 \\* 1 bag = 7 \\* x cookies\n\n14 = 7x\n\nx = 14 / 7\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, each bag has 2 cookies.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/822.png"}
