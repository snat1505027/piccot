{"question": "Jesse's room is 7 feet wide. If she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet. What is the length of her room?", "qid": "596", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the room. We know that the room is 7 feet wide, and we need a carpet of size 14 square feet. First, we need to convert the carpet size from square feet to square meters. There are 10.764 square meters in one square foot. So, 14 square feet is equal to 14 x 10.764 = 149.76 square meters.\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the room. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to do this. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the width of the room (7 feet), and the other two sides are the length and width of the carpet.\n\nThe length of the carpet is 149.76 square meters, and the width is 7 feet. To find the length, we need to find the square root of the sum of the squares of the length and width of the carpet.\n\nFirst, we convert the length of the carpet from meters to feet. There are 3.2808 feet in one meter. So, 149.76 square meters is equal to 149.76 x 3.2808 = 493.6 square feet.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n(7 feet)\u00b2 + (493.6 square feet)\u00b2 = (length of room)\u00b2\n\nSolving for the length of the room:\n\n49 x 49 + 493.6 x 493.6 = (length of room)\u00b2\n\n49 x 49 = 2,361\n493.6 x 493.6 = 236,196.4\n\n(2,361 + 236,196.4) = (length of room)\u00b2\n\n2,361 + 236,196.4 = 238,557.4\n\nTaking the", "answer": 2.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/596.png"}
