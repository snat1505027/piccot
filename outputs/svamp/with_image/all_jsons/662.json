{"question": "Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 17 marbles. How many marbles does Doug have now?", "qid": "662", "response": "First, we need to find out how many marbles Ed had initially. We know that Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug, so we can find the initial number of marbles Ed had by adding 12 to the number of marbles Doug had.\n\nLet's assume that Doug initially had x marbles. Then, Ed had x + 12 marbles.\n\nNext, we know that Ed lost 20 marbles at the playground. So, Ed now has x - 20 marbles.\n\nSince Ed and Doug both lost marbles, we can assume that Doug also lost 20 marbles. Therefore, Doug now has x - 20 marbles.\n\nFinally, we know that Ed had 17 marbles. We can find the initial number of marbles Ed had by adding 17 to the number of marbles Doug has now.\n\nThe answer is x - 20 + 17 = x - 3.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/662.png"}
