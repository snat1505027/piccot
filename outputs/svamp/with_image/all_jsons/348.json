We can do this by adding the weight of the strawberries they collected together (22 pounds) and the weight of the additional strawberries (30 pounds).\n\n22 + 30 = 52 pounds\n\nNow, we know that Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds. To find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed now, we can subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight of both their strawberries.\n\n52 - 36 = 16 pounds\n\nThe answer is 16 pounds.", "answer": 16.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/348.png"}
