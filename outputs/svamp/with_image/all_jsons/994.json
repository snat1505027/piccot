{"question": "Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax. How many grams of wax does he already have?", "qid": "994", "response": "The image shows a calculation for the total grams of wax needed for the feathers. The total grams of wax needed is 353 g. The feathers require 22 g of wax more, so the total grams of wax needed with the additional 22 g is 353 + 22 = 375 g. The feathers already have 22 g of wax, so the total grams of wax needed minus the wax already present is 375 - 22 = 353 g. The answer is 353 g.", "answer": 331.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/994.png"}
