{"question": "Jerry had 7 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added some more action figures to the shelf and removed 10 of the old ones. If there are 8 action figures on his shelf now. How many action figures did he add to the shelf?", "qid": "47", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of action figures on the shelf before and after Jerry added some more and removed some old ones.\n\nInitially, Jerry had 7 action figures on the shelf.\n\nAfter adding some more action figures, the total number of action figures on the shelf is 8.\n\nTo find the number of action figures Jerry added, we need to subtract the initial number of action figures (7) from the total number of action figures on the shelf (8).\n\n8 - 7 = 1\n\nSo, Jerry added 1 action figure to the shelf.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 11.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/47.png"}
