We know that there are 14 different movies and 15 different books in the 'crazy silly school' series.\n2. We also know that the person has read 11 books and watched 40 movies.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of books and movies.\n\n1. The number of books is 15.\n2. The number of movies is 40.\n3. To find the difference, we subtract the number of movies from the number of books:\n15 (books) - 40 (movies) = -25\n\nSince the result is negative, we need to change the sign to make it positive.\n\n1. Positive result: 25 (books) - 40 (movies) = -15\n\nThe answer is -15.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/942.png"}
