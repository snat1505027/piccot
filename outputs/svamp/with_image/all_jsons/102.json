{"question": "Allan brought 6 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. Jake then bought 4 more balloons at the park. How many more balloons did Jake have than Allan in the park?", "qid": "102", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of balloons Allan brought to the park. We know that Allan brought 6 balloons.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of balloons Jake brought to the park. We know that Jake brought 3 balloons and bought 4 more at the park. So, Jake brought a total of 3 + 4 = 7 balloons to the park.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of balloons Jake has and Allan has at the park. We can do this by subtracting the number of balloons Allan brought from the total number of balloons Jake brought: 7 - 6 = 1.\n\nSo, Jake has 1 more balloon than Allan at the park.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 1.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/102.png"}
