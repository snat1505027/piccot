{"question": "Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 266 of the pickers that they fill 90 drums of grapes in 5 days. How many drums of grapes would be filled in each day?", "qid": "315", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of grapes filled per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of grapes filled by the number of days.\n\n266 drums of grapes filled in 5 days\n\n266 \u00f7 5 = 53.2\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a drum, we need to round the number to the nearest whole number.\n\n53.2 rounded to the nearest whole number is 53.\n\nTherefore, 53 drums of grapes would be filled in each day.\n\nThe answer is 53.", "answer": 18.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/315.png"}
