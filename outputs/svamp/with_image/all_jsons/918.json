{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 66 classrooms. There are 102 students in the school and 8 seats on each school bus. If 22 students do n't want to go for the trip. How many buses are needed to take the trip?", "qid": "918", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of buses needed to transport the remaining students who want to go on the trip.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of students who want to go on the trip. Since there are 102 students in the school and 22 students do not want to go, we can find the number of students who want to go by subtracting 22 from 102:\n\n102 - 22 = 80\n\n2. Next, we need to find the number of students per bus. Since there are 8 seats on each school bus, we can find the number of students per bus by dividing the number of students who want to go by 8:\n\n80 \u00f7 8 = 10\n\n3. Finally, we need to find the number of buses needed to transport the students who want to go on the trip. We can find this by multiplying the number of students per bus by the number of students who want to go:\n\n10 (students per bus) \u00d7 80 (students who want to go) = 800\n\nThe answer is 800.", "answer": 10.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/918.png"}
