{"question": "There are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 345 groups and oranges are organized into 16 groups. How big is each group of oranges?", "qid": "777", "response": "First, we need to find the number of oranges in each group. We know that there are 384 oranges in total and 16 groups. To find the number of oranges in each group, we can divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups:\n\n384 oranges \u00f7 16 groups = 24 oranges per group\n\nNext, we need to find the size of each group of bananas. We know that there are 192 bananas in total and 345 groups. To find the size of each group of bananas, we can divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups:\n\n192 bananas \u00f7 345 groups = 0.55 bananas per group\n\nNow, we can find the size of each group of oranges by multiplying the number of oranges per group by the number of bananas per group:\n\n24 oranges per group \u00d7 0.55 bananas per group = 13.5 oranges per banana\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of an orange, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the size of each group of oranges is 14 oranges.\n\nThe answer is 14 oranges per group.", "answer": 24.0, "correct": true, "image": "images/svamp/777.png"}
