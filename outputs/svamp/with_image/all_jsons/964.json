{"question": "There are 2 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and some more green peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets. How many green peaches are in each basket?", "qid": "964", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green peaches in each basket. We know that there are a total of 12 peaches, and we are given that there are 2 baskets. We can start by finding the number of red peaches in each basket.\n\nNumber of red peaches in each basket = 4\n\nNow, we need to find the number of green peaches in each basket. Since there are a total of 12 peaches and 2 baskets, we can find the number of green peaches by subtracting the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches.\n\nNumber of green peaches in each basket = 12 - 4 = 8\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 2.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/964.png"}
