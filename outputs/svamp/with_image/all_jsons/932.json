{"question": "Paul had 2 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 150 new ones. If he has 58 books now. How many books did he sell?", "qid": "932", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of books Paul had before the garage sale and the number of books he bought at the garage sale. We can then subtract the number of books he had before the sale from the total number of books he has now to find the number of books he sold.\n\nLet's start by looking at the image. Paul had 2 books before the garage sale. After the sale, he bought 150 new books, bringing his total number of books to 152. Now, he has 58 books.\n\nTo find the number of books he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he had before the sale (2) from the total number of books he has now (58).\n\n2 (books he had before) + 150 (books he bought) = 152 (total books he has now)\n\n2 (books he had before) - 152 (total books he has now) = -150 (books he sold)\n\nThe answer is -150.", "answer": 94.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/932.png"}
