{"question": "Steven has 14 peaches. Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven and 3 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jill have?", "qid": "163", "response": "First, we need to find the number of peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can subtract 6 from 14 to find the number of peaches Jake has:\n\n14 - 6 = 8\n\nNext, we know that Jake has 3 more peaches than Jill. So, we can add 3 to the number of peaches Jill has to find the number of peaches Jake has:\n\n8 + 3 = 11\n\nNow, we know that Jill has 11 peaches. The answer is 11.", "answer": 5.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/163.png"}
