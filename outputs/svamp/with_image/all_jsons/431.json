{"question": "Each pack of dvds costs 107 dollars. If there is a discount of 106 dollars on each pack. How many packs of dvds can you buy with 93 dollars?", "qid": "431", "response": "First, we need to find the cost of each pack of DVDs after the discount. We can do this by subtracting the discount amount from the original cost:\n\n107 - 106 = 1\n\nNow, we need to find out how many packs of DVDs we can buy with 93 dollars. We can do this by dividing the amount we have by the cost of each pack:\n\n93 / 1 = 93\n\nSince we cannot buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of packs. In this case, we can buy 1 pack of DVDs.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 93.0, "correct": false, "image": "images/svamp/431.png"}
