Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus.

Then, 68 children got off the bus, and some more got on the bus. So, the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop is 36 + 68 + some more.\n\nLet's assume that the number of children who got on the bus is x. Then, the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop is 36 + 68 + x.\n\nWe are given that there are 12 children altogether on the bus after the bus stop. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n36 + 68 + x = 12\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 36 and 68 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 12 - 36 - 68\n\nx = 12 - 104\n\nx = -82\n\nSince the number of children who got on the bus is negative, it means that more children got off the bus than got on.

In this case, the right triangle is formed by the width and the length of the room.\n\nLet's call the length of the room 'x'.
