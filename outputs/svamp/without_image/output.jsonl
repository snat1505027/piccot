So, the total number of children on the bus after the new children got on is:\n\n82 + 28 = 110\n\nNow, we need to find the number of children who got off the bus.

We can do this by subtracting 7 from 60:\n\n60 - 7 = X\n\nX = 53\n\nSince we know that the number of afternoon campers is 53, we can now find the number of morning campers by subtracting the afternoon campers from the total campers:\n\n7 - 53 = -46\n\nThis is incorrect, as the number of campers cannot be negative.

There are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase.\n\nWe can represent the initial state of the vase with the following equation:\n\n13R + 84O = V\n\nWhere R represents the number of roses and O represents the number of orchids. V represents the total number of flowers in the vase.\n\nAfter Jessica cut some roses and orchids, the vase contains 91 orchids and 14 roses. We can represent the new state of the vase with the following equation:\n\n91O + 14R = V'\n\nNow, we need to find the number of roses that Jessica cut. To do this, we can use the difference between the initial and new state of the vase:\n\n13R + 84O - (91O + 14R) = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n13R - 91O - 14R = 0\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n-77R = 0\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of roses, we can conclude that Jessica did not cut any roses.

He now has 58 books in total.\n\nWe can represent this information using the following equation:\n\n2 + 150 = 58\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation to find the number of books Paul bought. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Add 2 to 150: 150 + 2 = 152\n2. Subtract 152 from 58: 58 - 152 = -94\n\nSince the result is negative, it means that Paul did not buy any books.

We know that there are 26 aquariums, and each aquarium has the same number of animals. So, the total number of saltwater animals is 26 aquariums \\* the number of animals per aquarium.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of animals per aquarium. We can do this by dividing the total number of saltwater animals by the number of aquariums.\n\nThe total number of saltwater animals is 26 aquariums \\* the number of animals per aquarium.\n\nThe number of aquariums is 26.\n\nSo, the number of animals per aquarium is:\n\n26 aquariums \\* the number of animals per aquarium = 26 \\* the number of animals per aquarium\n\nTo find the number of animals per aquarium, we can divide both sides of the equation by the number of aquariums:\n\n26 \\* the number of animals per aquarium = the number of animals per aquarium\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of animals per aquarium:\n\nthe number of animals per aquarium = 26 \\* the number of animals per aquarium\n\nthe number of animals per aquarium = the number of animals per aquarium\n\nThis equation is not useful, as it is a circular equation. We need to find a way to solve for the number of animals per aquarium without using the equation.\n\nSince there are 26 aquariums and each aquarium has the same number of animals, we can simply say that each aquarium has 26 animals.\n\nThe answer is 26 animals per aquarium.", "predict": "26.0", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "26.0", "is_correct_last": 0}

We can substitute \"x\" with the given information:\n\ny + x = 32\n\nNow, we need to find the value of \"x\". We know that \"x\" is the number of campers that went rowing in the morning. Since the problem states that \"some more campers went rowing in the afternoon,\" we can assume that the number of campers in the afternoon is greater than the number of campers in the morning. We can represent this by saying that \"x\" is less than \"y\".\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx + y = 32\nx < y\n\nNow, we can solve for \"x\" by subtracting \"y\" from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 32 - y\n\nSince \"x\" is less than \"y\", we can substitute \"x\" with its expression:\n\n32 - y = x\n\nNow, we can solve for \"y\":\n\ny = 32 - x\n\nWe can substitute \"x\" with its expression:\n\ny = 32 - (32 - y)\n\ny = 2y\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (32 \u00b1 sqrt(16 - 16y)) / 2\n\ny = 32 / 2\n\ny = 16\n\nNow that we have the value of \"y\", we can find the value of \"x\" by substituting it back into the original equation:\n\nx = 32 - y\nx = 32 - 16\nx = 16\n\nThe answer is 16.", "predict": "16.0", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "16.0", "is_correct_last": 0}
