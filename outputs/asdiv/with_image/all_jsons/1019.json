How much more does Anne's cat weigh?", "qid": "1019", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of Anne's cat. We know that the ratio of the weight of Meg's cat to Anne's cat is 5:7. We also know that Meg's cat weighs 20 kg.\n\nFirst, we need to find the weight of Anne's cat. To do this, we can use the fact that the ratio of the weight of Meg's cat to Anne's cat is 5:7. We can set up the following equation:\n\nWeight of Meg's cat / Weight of Anne's cat = 5 / 7\n\nNow, we can substitute the weight of Meg's cat, which is 20 kg, into the equation:\n\n20 kg / Weight of Anne's cat = 5 / 7\n\nTo solve for the weight of Anne's cat, we can divide both sides of the equation by 20 kg:\n\nWeight of Anne's cat = (20 kg / 5) \\* 7\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nWeight of Anne's cat = 14 kg \\* 7\n\nWeight of Anne's cat = 98 kg\n\nThe answer is 98 kg.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1019.png"}
