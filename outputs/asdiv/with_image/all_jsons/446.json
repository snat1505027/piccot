We know that each pitcher can serve 5 glasses, and we are given that 30 glasses were served.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of glasses that can be served by one pitcher. We can do this by dividing the number of glasses served by the number of glasses per pitcher:\n\n30 glasses served \u00f7 5 glasses per pitcher = 6 pitchers of lemonade\n\nSince we are given that 30 glasses were served, we can conclude that Christian's mother prepared 6 pitchers of lemonade.\n\nThe answer is 6 pitchers of lemonade.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/446.png"}
