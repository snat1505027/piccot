{"question": "A bus can transport 48 passengers. If a school of 1,230 students and teachers are going on a field trip, how many buses should be rented?", "qid": "732", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of buses needed to transport the entire group of 1,230 people.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of buses required to transport the 1,230 people. We can do this by dividing the total number of people by the number of passengers a bus can transport.\n\n1,230 people \u00f7 48 passengers per bus = 25.83 buses needed\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of buses.\n\n25.83 buses \u00f7 1 bus = 26 buses needed\n\nThe answer is 26 buses.", "answer": 26, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/732.png"}
