{"question": "Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?", "qid": "1268", "response": "First, we need to find the present age of Jacob's son. We know that five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nJacob's age (5 years ago) = 7 \\* Son's age (5 years ago)\n\nNext, we can solve for the son's age:\n\nSon's age (5 years ago) = Jacob's age (5 years ago) / 7\n\nNow, we need to find the present age of Jacob's son. We know that five years hence, Jacob's age will be three times that of his son. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nJacob's age (5 years hence) = 3 \\* Son's age (5 years hence)\n\nNext, we can solve for the son's age in five years:\n\nSon's age (5 years hence) = Jacob's age (5 years hence) / 3\n\nNow, we have the present age of Jacob's son:\n\nSon's age (present) = Son's age (5 years ago) + 5\n\nFinally, we can find Jacob's present age by using the equation:\n\nJacob's age (present) = Son's age (present) + 5\n\nThe answer is:\nJacob's age (present) = 5 + (Son's age (5 years ago) + 5) + 5 = 15 + 5 + 5 = 25\nSon's age (present) = 5 + (Jacob's age (5 years ago) / 7) + 5 = 5 + (7 / 7) + 5 = 5 + 1 + 5 = 11", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1268.png"}
