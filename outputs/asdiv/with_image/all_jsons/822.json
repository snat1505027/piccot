{"question": "Eric has two pieces of rope. One piece is 10 inches longer than the other. The total length of the two pieces is 40 inches. How long is the shorter piece?", "qid": "822", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. The two pieces of rope have a total length of 40 inches. One piece is 10 inches longer than the other. We can represent this by saying that the longer piece is x inches, and the shorter piece is x-10 inches.\n\nNow, we can use the equation: x + (x-10) = 40\n\nTo solve this equation, we can add x and (x-10) together:\n2x - 10 = 40\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by adding 10 to both sides:\n2x = 50\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x:\nx = 25\n\nThe shorter piece is x-10 = 15 inches.\n\nThe answer is 15 inches for the shorter piece and 25 inches for the longer piece.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/822.png"}
