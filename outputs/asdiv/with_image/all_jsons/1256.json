{"question": "There are 650 students in a school. If the number of girls is 106 more than the boys, how many boys are there in the school?", "qid": "1256", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boys in the school. We know that the number of girls is 106 more than the boys. Let's call the number of boys \"x\".\n\nGirls = x + 106\n\nWe can substitute the equation into the given information:\n\nTotal students = Girls + Boys\n\nTotal students = (x + 106) + x\n\nTotal students = 2x + 106\n\nWe know that the total number of students is 650. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n2x + 106 = 650\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"x\". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx + 53 = 325\n\nNow, we can subtract 53 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 325 - 53\n\nx = 272\n\nThe number of boys in the school is 272.\n\nThe answer is 272.", "answer": 272, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1256.png"}
