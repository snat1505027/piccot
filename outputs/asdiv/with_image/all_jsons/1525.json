{"question": "A pet store had seven Siamese cats. If they sold four of them, how many cats did they still have?", "qid": "1525", "response": "First, we need to find the number of cats that were sold. We know that four cats were sold, so we can represent this as 4 cats.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of cats that were left in the pet store. To do this, we can subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats.\n\n7 cats - 4 cats = 3 cats\n\nSo, the pet store still has three Siamese cats after selling four of them.\n\nThe answer is 3 cats.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1525.png"}
