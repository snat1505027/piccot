{"question": "The age of a father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children. After 15 years sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. Find the age of the father.", "qid": "1274", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the age of the father. Let's start by using the information provided in the problem:\n\n1. The age of a father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children.\n2. After 15 years, the sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father.\n\nWe can represent this information in the form of an equation:\n\nFather's age (F) = Sum of children's ages (C)\n\nAfter 15 years:\n\nF + 15 = 2C + 15\n\nNow, we need to find the age of the father. To do this, we can use the first equation to substitute the sum of the children's ages with the father's age:\n\nF = C\n\nThen, we can use the second equation to substitute the father's age with the sum of the children's ages:\n\nF + 15 = 2C + 15\n\nNow, we have a single equation with two variables:\n\nC = F + 15\n\nWe can solve this equation for C by subtracting F from both sides:\n\nC = F + 15 - F\n\nC = 15\n\nNow that we have the age of the children, we can find the age of the father by using the first equation:\n\nF = C\n\nF = 15\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 75, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1274.png"}
