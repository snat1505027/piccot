{"question": "At present Allen is 10 years younger than Scott. Five years from now, Scott's age will be 2 times the present age of Allen. Find the present age of Allen and Scott.", "qid": "1185", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the present age of both Allen and Scott. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\n1. Allen is 10 years younger than Scott.\n2. Five years from now, Scott's age will be 2 times the present age of Allen.\n\nWe can use the information from the image to create a system of equations:\n\n1. Scott's present age = 5 + 2 \\* Allen's present age\n2. Allen's present age = Scott's present age - 10\n\nNow we can solve the system of equations. First, we can substitute equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n5 + 2 \\* (Scott's present age - 10) = Scott's present age\n\nNext, we can simplify the equation:\n\n5 + 2 \\* Scott's present age - 20 = Scott's present age\n\nNow, we can solve for Scott's present age:\n\nScott's present age = (5 + 2 \\* Scott's present age - 20) / 2\n\nScott's present age = (5 + 2 \\* Scott's present age) / 2 - 10\n\nScott's present age = (5 + 2 \\* Scott's present age) / 2\n\nNow, we can solve for Allen's present age:\n\nAllen's present age = Scott's present age - 10\n\nAllen's present age = (5 + 2 \\* Scott's present age) / 2 - 10\n\nAllen's present age = (5 + 2 \\* (Scott's present age - 10)) / 2\n\nNow we have the equations for both Allen's and Scott's present ages. We can plug in the values for Scott's present age and solve for Allen's present age:\n\nAllen's present age = (5 + 2 \\* (Scott's present age - 10)) / 2\n\nAllen's present age = (5 + 2 \\* (Scott's present age - 10)) / 2\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1185.png"}
