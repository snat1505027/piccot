{"question": "For a party Cody bought eleven cupcakes. After the party he had two left. How many were eaten at the party? ", "qid": "1678", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cupcakes that were eaten at the party. We know that Cody bought eleven cupcakes and had two left, so we can set up the equation:\n\n11 cupcakes bought - 2 cupcakes left = X cupcakes eaten\n\nWe can simplify the equation by subtracting the two left cupcakes from the eleven bought cupcakes:\n\n9 cupcakes eaten = 11 cupcakes bought - 2 cupcakes left\n\nNow we can solve the equation by dividing both sides by 9:\n\nX cupcakes eaten = (11 cupcakes bought - 2 cupcakes left) / 9\n\nX cupcakes eaten = 1.2222...\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a cupcake, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number. The answer is 1 cupcake.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1678.png"}
