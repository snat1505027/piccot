{"question": "A company buys 88 bureaus for 14 offices. If each office should get an equal number of bureaus, how many more bureaus are needed at least?", "qid": "785", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bureaus needed for each office. First, we need to find the average number of bureaus per office. To do this, we divide the total number of bureaus (88) by the total number of offices (14).\n\n88 \u00f7 14 = 6.2857\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bureau, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n6.2857 \u2248 6\n\nNow, we know that each office should have 6 bureaus. To find out how many more bureaus are needed, we subtract the current number of bureaus per office (6) from the desired number of bureaus per office (6).\n\n6 - 6 = 0\n\nSince the number of bureaus needed is already equal to the desired number, there are no more bureaus needed. The answer is 0.", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/785.png"}
