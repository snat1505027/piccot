{"question": "A man is thrice as old as his son. After 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son. Find their present ages.", "qid": "1257", "response": "First, we need to find the present age of the son. We know that the man is thrice as old as his son, so we can set up the equation:\n\nMan's age = 3 \u00d7 Son's age\n\nNext, we know that after 12 years, the man will be twice as old as his son. We can represent this as:\n\nMan's age after 12 years = 2 \u00d7 Son's age after 12 years\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. Man's age = 3 \u00d7 Son's age\n2. Man's age after 12 years = 2 \u00d7 Son's age after 12 years\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously by setting the two expressions equal to each other and solving for the son's age:\n\n3 \u00d7 Son's age = 2 \u00d7 Son's age after 12 years\n\nSon's age = Son's age after 12 years\n\nNow, we can find the present age of the man by using the first equation:\n\nMan's age = 3 \u00d7 Son's age\n\nMan's age = 3 \u00d7 Son's age after 12 years\n\nThe answer is <3 \u00d7 Son's age after 12 years>.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1257.png"}
