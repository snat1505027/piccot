{"question": "Fred bought five new baseball trading cards to add to his collection. The next day his dog ate half of his collection. There are now only twenty-six cards left. How many cards did Fred start with ?", "qid": "1249", "response": "The image shows a math problem related to Fred's baseball cards. The problem states that Fred bought five new baseball trading cards and the next day his dog ate half of his collection. There are now only twenty-six cards left. To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Fred started with.\n\nLet's start by using the information provided in the problem. Fred bought five new baseball cards, so he had a total of five cards initially. The next day, his dog ate half of his collection, which means that the number of cards was reduced by half.\n\nTo find out the initial number of cards, we can use the following equation:\n\nInitial number of cards = Total number of cards - Number of cards eaten by the dog\n\nIn this case, the initial number of cards would be:\n\nInitial number of cards = 5 - 1/2 = 5 - 2.5 = 2.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a card, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the initial number of cards was 2. We can now use this information to find the answer to the problem.\n\nThe answer is: Fred started with 2 baseball cards.", "answer": 47, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1249.png"}
