{"question": "A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many small barrels should be used?", "qid": "761", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of small barrels needed to hold the remaining oil after filling the large barrels.\n\n1. First, we need to find the total capacity of large barrels. Since there are 95 tons of oil and each large barrel can hold 6 tons, we can calculate the total capacity of large barrels as follows:\n\n95 tons / 6 tons per large barrel = 15.83 large barrels\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total capacity of small barrels. Since there are 15.83 large barrels and each large barrel can hold 6 tons, we can calculate the total capacity of small barrels as follows:\n\n15.83 large barrels \\* 5 tons per small barrel = 79.15 small barrels\n\n3. Since we want to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, we need to find the remainder of the oil that cannot be held by the large and small barrels.\n\n95 tons of oil - (15.83 large barrels \\* 6 tons per large barrel) - (79.15 small barrels \\* 5 tons per small barrel) = 1.05 tons of oil left over\n\n4. Since we have 1.05 tons of oil left over, we can find the number of small barrels needed by dividing the remaining oil by the capacity of a small barrel:\n\n1.05 tons of oil / 5 tons per small barrel = 0.21 small barrels\n\nThe answer is 0.21 small barrels.", "answer": 1, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/761.png"}
