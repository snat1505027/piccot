{"question": "Jaden is putting together first-aid kits. He has 39 large bandages and 26 small bandages, and he wants each kit to be identical, with no bandages left over. What is the greatest number of first-aid kits Jaden could put together?", "qid": "1071", "response": "To find the greatest number of first-aid kits Jaden can put together, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of large bandages and small bandages.\n\n39 \u00f7 26 = 1.54 (rounded down)\n26 \u00f7 1.54 = 17.29 (rounded down)\n\nThe GCD of 39 and 26 is 17.\n\nTo find the greatest number of first-aid kits, we need to divide the total number of bandages by the GCD:\n\n39 large bandages + 26 small bandages = 65 bandages\n65 bandages \u00f7 17 = 3.82 (rounded down)\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 13, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1071.png"}
