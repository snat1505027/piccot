{"question": "Gabe and Steven make money by walking neighborhood pets. During a conversation about their work, they realize that they are both walking the same total number of pets, even though Gabe walks pets in groups of 2 and Steven walks pets in groups of 10. What is the smallest total number of pets each could be walking?", "qid": "1104", "response": "To find the smallest total number of pets each could be walking, we need to find the common multiple of 2 and 10. The smallest multiple that is a common factor of both 2 and 10 is 20.\n\nGabe walks pets in groups of 2, so the smallest number of pets he could be walking is 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nSteven walks pets in groups of 10, so the smallest number of pets he could be walking is 20 / 10 = 2.\n\nThe answer is 10.", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1104.png"}
