{"question": "The sum of three consecutive numbers is 90. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?", "qid": "1253", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number in the sequence of three consecutive numbers. We can start by looking at the sum of the three numbers, which is 90. Let's call the smallest number x. The next two numbers in the sequence would be x+1 and x+2.\n\nThe sum of these three numbers would be:\nx + (x+1) + (x+2) = 3x + 3 = 90\n\nFrom this equation, we can deduce that x = 27. Therefore, the smallest number in the sequence is 27.\n\nThe answer is 27.", "answer": 29, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1253.png"}
