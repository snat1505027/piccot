{"question": "On a modern art painting, there are 3 green dots in the first row, 6 green dots in the second row, 9 green dots in the third row, and 12 green dots in the fourth row. If this pattern continues, how many green dots will there be in the fifth row?", "qid": "992", "response": "To find the number of green dots in the fifth row, we need to find the pattern in the given sequence. The sequence is 3, 6, 9, 12, and we can see that the difference between consecutive numbers is 3.\n\nSo, to find the number of green dots in the fifth row, we can add 3 to the number of green dots in the fourth row, which is 12.\n\n12 + 3 = 15\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/992.png"}
