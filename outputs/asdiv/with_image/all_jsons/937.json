{"question": "Amelia works at the candy store. She has to sell 90 Jet Bars each week. She sold 45 on Monday. She sold 16 fewer Jet Bars on Tuesday. How many more Jet Bars does Ameila have to sell?", "qid": "937", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of Jet Bars Amelia has to sell on the remaining days of the week.\n\n1. On Monday, Amelia sold 45 Jet Bars.\n2. On Tuesday, she sold 16 fewer Jet Bars, which means she sold 45 - 16 = 29 Jet Bars.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of Jet Bars Amelia has to sell for the remaining days of the week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can assume that Amelia has already sold 45 + 29 = 74 Jet Bars.\n\nTo find the total number of Jet Bars Amelia has to sell, we need to subtract the number of Jet Bars she has already sold from the total number of Jet Bars she has to sell each week.\n\nTotal number of Jet Bars Amelia has to sell = 90 Jet Bars\nTotal number of Jet Bars Amelia has sold = 45 + 29 = 74 Jet Bars\n\nNumber of Jet Bars Amelia has to sell = 90 Jet Bars - 74 Jet Bars = 16 Jet Bars\n\nThe answer is 16 Jet Bars.", "answer": 16, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/937.png"}
