{"question": "The sides of scalene triangle are in the ratio 2:4:3 and its perimeter are 27 inches. Find the sides of the triangle.", "qid": "1203", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the appropriate formulas.\n\n1. We know that the sides of the scalene triangle are in the ratio 2:4:3. Let's call the sides a, b, and c, respectively.\n2. We also know that the perimeter of the triangle is 27 inches. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its sides.\n\nP = a + b + c\n\n27 = a + b + c\n\n1. Now, we can use the ratio of the sides to find the length of one side. Let's find the length of side b.\n\nb = 4a\n\n2. Substitute the expression for b into the equation for the perimeter:\n\n27 = a + 4a + c\n\n27 = 5a + c\n\n3. Now, we can solve for c:\n\nc = 27 - 5a\n\n4. We know that the sides are in the ratio 2:4:3, so we can find the length of side a:\n\na = (c - 3b) / 2\n\na = (27 - 5a - 12) / 2\n\n5. Solve for a:\n\na = (27 - 5a - 12) / 2\n\na = 27 - 5a - 12\n\na = 27 - 5a - 12\n\n6. Now, we have the length of side a:\n\na = 27 - 5a - 12\n\na = 27 - 5a - 12\n\nThe answer is 27 - 5a - 12.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1203.png"}
