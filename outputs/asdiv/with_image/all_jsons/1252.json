{"question": "The sum of three consecutive odd numbers is one hundred twenty-three. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?", "qid": "1252", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest odd number that, when added to the other two odd numbers, results in a total of one hundred twenty-three.\n\nLet's start by finding the middle number. Since the sum of three consecutive odd numbers is one hundred twenty-three, we can write the equation:\n\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 123\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3x + 6 = 123\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\n3x = 123 - 6\n\n3x = 117\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nx = 117 / 3\n\nx = 39\n\nNow that we have the middle number, we can find the smallest odd number by subtracting 2 from 39.\n\nThe smallest odd number is 37.\n\nThe answer is 37.", "answer": 39, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1252.png"}
