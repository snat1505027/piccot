{"question": "In a room containing 45 students there were twice as many girls as boys. How many of each, were there?", "qid": "1313", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of girls and boys in the room. Let's start by looking at the image.\n\n1. Total students: 45\n2. Number of girls: 2x the number of boys\n3. Number of boys: 1/2 the number of girls\n\nWe can use the information from the image to set up a proportion:\n\nGirls:Boys = 2:1\n\nWe can also set up an equation:\n\nGirls + Boys = Total students\n\nNow, we can solve the equation:\n\n2G + 1/2G = 45\n\nCombine the equations:\n\n2G + 1/2G = 45\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n\nNow, we can solve for G:\n\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G = 45 - 1/2G\n2G", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1313.png"}
