{"question": "In a play school, there are 16 red balls and the rest are white balls. The ratio of red balls to white balls is 4:5. Find the number of white balls.", "qid": "799", "response": "To find the number of white balls, we need to first find the total number of balls. We know that the ratio of red balls to white balls is 4:5, so we can write the equation 4x + 5y = 16, where x represents the number of red balls and y represents the number of white balls.\n\nWe can solve this equation by first finding the value of x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\nx + y = 4\n\nNow, we can find the value of y by subtracting x from both sides of the equation:\n\ny = 4 - x\n\nWe know that the total number of balls is 16, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n4x + 5(4 - x) = 16\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n4x + 20 - 5x = 16\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n-x = 4\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = -4/5\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y by substituting it back into the equation:\n\ny = 4 - x\ny = 4 - (-4/5)\ny = 4 + 4/5\ny = 8/5\n\nThe answer is 8/5.", "answer": 20, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/799.png"}
