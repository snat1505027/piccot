{"question": "There are 22 dogs in the farm. They live in 5 dog-houses equally. How many dogs are left?", "qid": "753", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dogs are in each dog-house and then find out how many dogs are left.\n\nThere are 22 dogs in the farm, and they are living in 5 dog-houses. To find out how many dogs are in each dog-house, we need to divide the total number of dogs by the total number of dog-houses.\n\n22 dogs \u00f7 5 dog-houses = 4.4 dogs per dog-house\n\nSince there are 5 dog-houses, we can round up the number of dogs per dog-house to 5 dogs.\n\nNow, we know that each dog-house has 5 dogs. To find out how many dogs are left, we need to subtract the total number of dogs from the total number of dog-houses.\n\n22 dogs - 5 dog-houses = 17 dogs left\n\nThe answer is 17 dogs left.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/753.png"}
