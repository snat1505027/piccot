{"question": "A clothing company used 2 buttons on jeans and 5 buttons on shirts. If they made 9 shirts and 1 pair of jeans, how many buttons would they use total?", "qid": "1897", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of buttons used. We can do this by adding the number of buttons used on jeans and shirts.\n\n2 buttons used on jeans + 5 buttons used on shirts = 7 buttons used on clothing items.\n\nSince the company made 9 shirts, we can find the total number of buttons used by multiplying the number of buttons used on shirts by the number of shirts made.\n\n7 buttons used on shirts \u00d7 9 shirts = 63 buttons used on shirts.\n\nAdding the number of buttons used on jeans to the number of buttons used on shirts gives us the total number of buttons used.\n\n2 buttons used on jeans + 63 buttons used on shirts = 65 buttons used total.\n\nThe answer is 65.", "answer": 47, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1897.png"}
