{"question": "The Central City Zoo has 45 chimpanzees. Every day the chimps eat a total of 72 bananas. Next week, the zoo is moving 18 chimps to a new cage. How many chimps will stay in the old cage?", "qid": "855", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chimps that will stay in the old cage after the 18 chimps are moved to the new cage.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of chimps in the old cage. We know that there are 45 chimpanzees in the zoo, and we are told that 18 chimps will be moved to a new cage. So, the total number of chimps in the old cage will be:\n\n45 chimpanzees - 18 chimps = <<45-18=27>>27 chimps\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of bananas that the 27 chimps will consume in a day. We know that the chimps eat a total of 72 bananas every day. So, the total number of bananas consumed by the 27 chimps will be:\n\n27 chimps x 72 bananas/day = <<27*72=1964>>1964 bananas\n\nFinally, we can find the number of bananas that the 27 chimps will consume in a week by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:\n\n1964 bananas/day x 7 days/week = <<1964*7=13788>>13788 bananas\n\nThe answer is 13788 bananas.", "answer": 27, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/855.png"}
