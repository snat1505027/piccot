How much did his dad's strawberries weigh?", "qid": "978", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of the dad's strawberries. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\nMarco's strawberries weighed 14 pounds.\nTogether, their strawberries weighed 23 pounds.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the weights:\n\nMarco's strawberries + Dad's strawberries = Total strawberries\n\n14 + Dad's strawberries = 23\n\nNow, we need to solve for Dad's strawberries. To do this, we can subtract 14 from 23:\n\nDad's strawberries = 23 - 14\n\nDad's strawberries = 9\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/978.png"}
