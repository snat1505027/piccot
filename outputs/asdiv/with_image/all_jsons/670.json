{"question": "Bernard had 15 red notebooks, 17 blue notebooks and 19 white notebooks. He gave some of them to Tom and had 5 left. How many notebooks did Bernard give Tom?", "qid": "670", "response": "Bernard had 15 red notebooks, 17 blue notebooks, and 19 white notebooks, making a total of 15 + 17 + 19 = 51 notebooks. He gave some of them to Tom, leaving him with 5 notebooks.\n\nLet's assume that Bernard gave x notebooks to Tom. The number of notebooks Bernard had left would be 51 - x. Since Bernard had 5 notebooks left, we can set up the equation:\n\n51 - x = 5\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 51 - 5\nx = 46\n\nThe answer is 46.", "answer": 46, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/670.png"}
