To find the original number of songs on his MP3 player, we need to find the number of songs he kept.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of songs he kept. We know that the ratio is 10:3, so we can set up a proportion equation:\n\n20 songs deleted : x songs kept\n10 : 3\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n20 \\* 3 = 10 \\* x\n60 = 10x\nx = 6\n\nKaleb originally had 6 songs on his MP3 player.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 26, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1497.png"}
