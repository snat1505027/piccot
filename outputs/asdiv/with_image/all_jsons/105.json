{"question": "Robin had 18 pieces of gum. Her brother gave her some more pieces. Now Robin has 44 pieces in all. How many pieces of gum did Robin's brother give her?", "qid": "105", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces of gum Robin's brother gave her. Let's start by using the information we have:\n\n1. Robin had 18 pieces of gum initially.\n2. Her brother gave her some more pieces, increasing the total number of pieces to 44.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\n18 + x = 44\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation to find the value of x, which represents the number of pieces of gum Robin's brother gave her.\n\nTo solve the equation, we can add 18 to both sides:\n\n18 + 18 = 44\n\nNow, we have 36 on both sides. Since 36 is equal to 36, we can conclude that Robin's brother gave her 18 pieces of gum.\n\nThe answer is 18.", "answer": 26, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/105.png"}
