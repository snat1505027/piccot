{"question": "A coat factory had 29 coats. If they wanted to put them into 3 boxes, with the same number of coats in each box, how many extra coats would they have left over?", "qid": "1112", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of coats that can fit into each box. We can do this by dividing the total number of coats by the number of boxes.\n\n29 coats \u00f7 3 boxes = 9.67 coats per box\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a coat, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of coats per box.\n\n9.67 coats \u00f7 3 boxes = 3.22 coats per box\n\nNow, we can find the number of extra coats by subtracting the number of coats per box from the total number of coats.\n\n29 coats - 3.22 coats per box = 25.78 coats left over\n\nThe answer is 25.78 coats left over.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1112.png"}
