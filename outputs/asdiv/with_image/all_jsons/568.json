To do this, we can divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of children:\n\n96 cupcakes \u00f7 8 children = <<96/8=12>>12 cupcakes per child\n\nNow, we need to find the number of cupcakes each child will get if they share the 96 cupcakes equally among the 8 children. To do this, we can divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of children and then multiply the result by the number of children:\n\n12 cupcakes per child \u00d7 8 children = <<12\u00d78=96>>96 cupcakes\n\nThe answer is 96 cupcakes.", "answer": 12, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/568.png"}
