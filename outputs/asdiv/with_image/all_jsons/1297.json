{"question": "A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?", "qid": "1297", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the time spent on the uphill and downhill sections. We can use the total distance covered (650 km) and the average speed for each section to find the time spent on each section.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total time spent on the trip. We can do this by dividing the total distance covered by the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nTotal distance covered: 650 km\nAverage speed for the entire trip: (30 km/h + 50 km/h) / 2 = 40 km/h\n\nTotal time spent: 650 km / 40 km/h = 16.25 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the time spent on the uphill and downhill sections. We can do this by dividing the total time spent by the average speed for each section.\n\nUphill average speed: 30 km/h\nDownhill average speed: 50 km/h\n\nTime spent on uphill: 16.25 hours / 30 km/h = 544.17 hours\nTime spent on downhill: 16.25 hours / 50 km/h = 325 hours\n\nThe answer is:\nUphill: 544.17 hours\nDownhill: 325 hours", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1297.png"}
