We know that she has five shelves of mystery books and three shelves of picture books. We can start by finding the total number of books on the shelves of mystery books.\n\n1. Multiply the number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf: 5 shelves x 4 books/shelf = 20 books in total for the mystery books.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of books on the shelves of picture books.\n\n1. Multiply the number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf: 3 shelves x 3 books/shelf = 9 books in total for the picture books.\n\nNow, we can add the total number of books from both shelves to find the total number of books Gwen has.\n\n1. Add the total number of books from the mystery books and the picture books: 20 books + 9 books = 29 books in total.\n\nThe answer is 29 books.", "answer": 32, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2006.png"}
