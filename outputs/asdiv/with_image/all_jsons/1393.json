{"question": "A post office has five hundred eighty-two pieces of junk mail they want to split evenly between seven mail trucks. How many extra pieces of junk mail will they have if they give each truck the same amount?", "qid": "1393", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of junk mail each mail truck will receive if they are divided evenly.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of pieces of junk mail: 582.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of mail trucks: 7.\n\nTo find the number of pieces of junk mail per mail truck, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of mail trucks:\n\n582 \u00f7 7 = 82 pieces of junk mail per mail truck.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many extra pieces of junk mail there will be if they give each truck the same amount. To do this, we can subtract the number of pieces per truck from the total number of pieces:\n\n582 - 82 = 500 pieces of junk mail.\n\nSince there are 500 pieces of junk mail left over, we can conclude that the post office will have 500 extra pieces of junk mail if they give each truck the same amount.\n\nThe answer is 500.", "answer": 1, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1393.png"}
