{"question": "A florist has 12 tulips and 18 carnations. If the florist wants to create identical bouquets without any leftover flowers, what is the greatest number of bouquets the florist can make?", "qid": "1078", "response": "To find the greatest number of bouquets the florist can make, we need to find the total number of flowers the florist has and divide it by the number of flowers per bouquet.\n\n12 tulips + 18 carnations = 30 flowers\n\nTo find the number of flowers per bouquet, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of tulips and carnations.\n\nLCM(12, 18) = 36\n\nSince the florist has 30 flowers and the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36, the florist can make 36 bouquets without any leftover flowers.\n\nThe answer is 36.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1078.png"}
