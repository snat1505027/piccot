{"question": "For the second main course, they were asked to make 500 pieces of fish fillets. If the first team made 189 pieces and the second team made 131 pieces, how many pieces should the third team make?", "qid": "323", "response": "To find the total number of pieces made by the first and second teams, we need to add their respective numbers: 189 + 131 = 320.\n\nSince the third team should make the remaining pieces, we can calculate the number of pieces they should make by subtracting the total number of pieces made by the first and second teams from the total pieces needed: 500 - 320 = 180.\n\nThe answer is 180.", "answer": 180, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/323.png"}
