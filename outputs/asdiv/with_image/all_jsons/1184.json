{"question": "The sum of the ages of Tony and Teddy equals their mother's age. Tony is two years younger than Teddy. If the age of the mother is 42, find the ages of Tony and Teddy?", "qid": "1184", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. The sum of the ages of Tony and Teddy is equal to their mother's age. We know that the mother's age is 42.\n\nLet's represent the ages of Tony and Teddy as x and y, respectively. Since Tony is two years younger than Teddy, we can say that x = y - 2.\n\nNow, we can use the equation that the sum of their ages is equal to their mother's age:\n\nx + y = 42\n\nWe can substitute the equation for x in terms of y:\n\ny + (y - 2) = 42\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n2y - 2 = 42\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n2y = 44\n\nDivide by 2:\n\ny = 22\n\nNow that we have the age of Teddy, we can find the age of Tony:\n\nx = y - 2\n\nx = 22 - 2\n\nx = 20\n\nThe ages of Tony and Teddy are 20 and 22, respectively.\n\nThe answer is Tony is 20 and Teddy is 22.", "answer": 20, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1184.png"}
