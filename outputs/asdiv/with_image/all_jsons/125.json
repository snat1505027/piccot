{"question": "Sarah had some trucks. She gave 13 to Jeff, and now she has 38 trucks left. How many trucks did Sarah have to start with?", "qid": "125", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of trucks Sarah had. Let's call that number x.\n\n1. Sarah had x trucks.\n2. She gave 13 trucks to Jeff, leaving her with x - 13 trucks.\n3. Now she has 38 trucks left, so we can write:\nx - 13 = 38\n\n1. Solve the equation: x - 13 = 38\n2. Add 13 to both sides: x = 51\n\nThe answer is 51.", "answer": 51, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/125.png"}
