How many pairs of shoes did the shop sell?", "qid": "672", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pairs of shoes that were initially stocked and then subtract the number of pairs left from that total.\n\n1. Total pairs of shoes initially stocked = 22 + 50 + 24 = 96 pairs\n2. Total pairs of shoes left = 96 - 13 = 83 pairs\n\nThe answer is 83 pairs of shoes were sold.", "answer": 83, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/672.png"}
