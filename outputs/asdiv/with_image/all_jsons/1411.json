{"question": "A builder needed to buy one hundred fifty-four boards for his latest project. If the boards he needs come in packs of three, how many packages will he need to buy?", "qid": "1411", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of packages needed to buy one hundred fifty-four boards if the boards come in packs of three.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of boards in one package. To do this, we can divide the number of boards needed by the number of boards per package.\n\n154 boards \u00f7 3 boards per package = 51.33 packages\n\nSince we cannot buy a fraction of a package, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of packages.\n\n51.33 packages rounded up to the nearest whole number of packages = 52 packages\n\nThe answer is 52 packages.", "answer": 52, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1411.png"}
