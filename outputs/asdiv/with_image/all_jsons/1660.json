{"question": "Maria took sixteen fish out of her fish tank. Now there are three fish in the tank. How many fish were in the tank to start with? ", "qid": "1660", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of fish in the tank. We know that Maria took sixteen fish out of the tank, leaving three fish behind. We can set up the equation:\n\nInitial number of fish - 16 = 3\n\nNow we need to solve for the initial number of fish. To do this, we can add 16 to both sides of the equation:\n\nInitial number of fish = 3 + 16\n\nInitial number of fish = 19\n\nThe answer is 19.", "answer": 19, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1660.png"}
