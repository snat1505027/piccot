{"question": "Vondra is putting together bags of groceries to donate to charity. She has 7 boxes of macaroni and cheese and 14 cans of vegetables. Vondra wants to divide them up evenly, so that each bag has the same contents and no items are left over. What is the greatest number of bags of groceries Vondra can put together?", "qid": "1068", "response": "To find the greatest number of bags of groceries Vondra can put together, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 14. The GCD of 7 and 14 is 7.\n\nSince Vondra wants to divide the items evenly, we can divide the total number of items (7 boxes of macaroni and cheese and 14 cans of vegetables) by the GCD (7) to find the number of bags she can put together.\n\n7 (total items) \u00f7 7 (GCD) = 1 bag\n\nTherefore, Vondra can put together 1 bag of groceries.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1068.png"}
