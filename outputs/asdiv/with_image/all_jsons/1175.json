{"question": "Tina is 3 years younger than Tom. The ages are in the ratio 2:3. Find their ages.", "qid": "1175", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Tina and Tom. We know that Tina is 3 years younger than Tom, so we can start by finding Tom's age.\n\nLet's assume Tom's age is x. Since the ages are in the ratio 2:3, we can write the equation:\n\nx / 3 = 2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 3 \\* 2\nx = 6\n\nNow that we have Tom's age, we can find Tina's age by subtracting 3 years from Tom's age:\n\nTina's age = Tom's age - 3\nTina's age = 6 - 3\nTina's age = 3\n\nThe answer is Tina is 3 years old and Tom is 6 years old.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1175.png"}
