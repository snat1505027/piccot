{"question": "Charles found 6 pennies on his way to school. He also had 3 nickels already at home. How much money does he now have in all?", "qid": "77", "response": "First, we need to find the value of the pennies and the nickels. There are 6 pennies, and each penny is worth $0.01. So, the value of the pennies is $0.01 x 6 = $0.06.\n\nNext, we need to find the value of the nickels. There are 3 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.25. So, the value of the nickels is $0.25 x 3 = $0.75.\n\nNow, we can add the value of the pennies and the nickels to find the total value of the money Charles has. The total value is $0.06 + $0.75 = $0.81.\n\nThe answer is $0.81.", "answer": 21, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/77.png"}
