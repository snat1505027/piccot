{"question": "Maria and her sister want to buy a present for their mother. Maria has $17. Her sister has double that amount. They want to buy their mom a coat that costs $80. How much more money do they need?", "qid": "833", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money needed to buy the coat. We can do this by adding the amount of money Maria has and the amount her sister has.\n\nMaria has $17, and her sister has $34. So, the total amount of money they have is $17 + $34 = $<<17+34=51>>51.\n\nThe coat costs $80. So, the total amount of money needed is $80.\n\nSince the total amount of money they have is less than the amount needed, they need more money to buy the coat. The difference between the total amount of money they have and the amount needed is $80 - $51 = $<<80-51=31>>31.\n\nThe answer is $31.", "answer": 29, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/833.png"}
