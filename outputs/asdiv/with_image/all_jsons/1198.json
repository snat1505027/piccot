{"question": "One-third of certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. Find the number and check your calculation.", "qid": "1198", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number that, when multiplied by one-third, gives eight-fifteenth of the number. We can start by dividing the number by eight-fifteenth to find the number we are looking for.\n\nLet's call the number x.\n\nx \\* (1/3) = (8/15)x\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by (1/3):\n\nx = (8/15)x \\* (1/3)\n\nx = (8/15) \\* (1/3)x\n\nx = (8/15) \\* (1/3) \\* x\n\nx = (8/15) \\* (1/3)^2\n\nx = (8/15) \\* (1/9)\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15\n\nx = 8/15 \\* 9/15", "answer": 1, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1198.png"}
