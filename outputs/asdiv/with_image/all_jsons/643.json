{"question": "Many families serve each person in the family one 6-ounce glass of orange juice each morning. If they buy orange juice by the gallon, how many whole servings of juice will they get out of one gallon (one gallon = 4 quarts, 1 quart = 32 ounces) of juice?", "qid": "643", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of servings per gallon of orange juice. We know that one gallon contains 4 quarts, and one quart contains 32 ounces. To find the number of servings, we need to divide the number of ounces in a gallon by the number of ounces in a quart.\n\nNumber of ounces in a gallon = 4 quarts x 32 ounces per quart = 128 ounces\n\nNumber of servings per gallon = 128 ounces / 32 ounces per quart = 4 servings\n\nThe answer is 4 servings per gallon.", "answer": 21, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/643.png"}
