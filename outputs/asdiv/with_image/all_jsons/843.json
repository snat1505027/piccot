{"question": "Ben had some baseball cards. His friend, Tim, had 20 cards. After Ben bought 3 more cards, he had twice as many cards as Tim. How many cards did Ben have at first?", "qid": "843", "response": "Ben had some baseball cards. His friend, Tim, had 20 cards. After Ben bought 3 more cards, he had twice as many cards as Tim.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of cards Ben had at first. We can do this by using the information that Ben had half as many cards as Tim.\n\n20 (cards Tim had) / 2 (cards Ben had) = 10\n\nSo, Ben had 10 cards at first.\n\nAfter Ben bought 3 more cards, he had a total of 10 + 3 = 13 cards.\n\nSince Ben now has twice as many cards as Tim, we can find the number of cards Tim has by dividing Ben's total number of cards by 2.\n\n13 (cards Ben has) / 2 (cards Tim has) = 6.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a card, we can round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n6.5 (cards Tim has) = 7\n\nNow we know that Tim had 7 cards before Ben bought 3 more cards.\n\nThe answer is 10.", "answer": 37, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/843.png"}
