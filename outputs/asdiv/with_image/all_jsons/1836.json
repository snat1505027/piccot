{"question": "Li Na is going to plant 63 tomato plants and 81 rhubarb plants. Li Na would like to plant the plants in rows where each row has the same number of tomato plants and each row has the same number of rhubarb plants. What is the greatest number of rows Li Na can plant?", "qid": "1836", "response": "To find the greatest number of rows Li Na can plant, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 63 and 81. We can do this by dividing both numbers by their prime factors and then finding the highest common factor.\n\n63 = 3^3 \\* 7\n81 = 3^2 \\* 7\n\nThe prime factors of 63 are 3 and 7, and the prime factors of 81 are 3 and 7. The highest common factor is 7, as both numbers have a 7 as a prime factor.\n\nTo find the number of rows, we can divide the total number of plants (63 + 81) by the number of plants per row (7).\n\n63 + 81 = 144\n144 \u00f7 7 = 20\n\nThe answer is 20.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1836.png"}
