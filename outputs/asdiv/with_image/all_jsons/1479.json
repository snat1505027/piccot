{"question": "A piece of plywood had a total area of 24 square feet, with a width of 6 feet. What is the length of the wood?", "qid": "1479", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the plywood. We know that the total area of the plywood is 24 square feet and the width is 6 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the length:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n\nSince we know the total area and the width, we can set up the equation:\n\n24 = Length x 6\n\nNow, we need to solve for the length. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\nLength = 24 / 6\n\nLength = 4\n\nThe answer is 4 feet.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1479.png"}
