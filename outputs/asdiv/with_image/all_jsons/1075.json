First, we need to find the total number of carrot sticks and baby potatoes.\n2. Next, we need to find the greatest number of plates that can be made by dividing the total number of carrot sticks and baby potatoes evenly.\n\nTotal number of carrot sticks = 15\nTotal number of baby potatoes = 10\n\nGreatest number of plates = (15 carrot sticks + 10 baby potatoes) / 2\n\nGreatest number of plates = (15 + 10) / 2\nGreatest number of plates = 25 / 2\nGreatest number of plates = 12.5\n\nThe answer is 12.5.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1075.png"}
