{"question": "At the end of the party, Mona gave away some souvenirs to her 6 closest friends. If each of them received 2 souvenir items, how many souvenirs did Mona give away?", "qid": "359", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of souvenirs Mona gave away. We know that she gave away 6 souvenirs to her friends, and each friend received 2 souvenirs.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of souvenirs Mona gave away to her friends. We can do this by multiplying the number of friends by the number of souvenirs each friend received:\n\n6 friends \\* 2 souvenirs/friend = 12 souvenirs\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of souvenirs Mona gave away in total. We can do this by adding the total number of souvenirs she gave away to her friends to the number of souvenirs she kept for herself:\n\n12 souvenirs (given to friends) + X souvenirs (kept by Mona) = Total number of souvenirs\n\nSince Mona gave away 12 souvenirs to her friends, we can set up the equation:\n\nX = 12 + 12 = 24\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 12, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/359.png"}
