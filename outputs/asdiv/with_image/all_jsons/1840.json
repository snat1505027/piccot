{"question": "Two of the lights at the local stadium are flickering. They both just flickered at the same time. One of the lights flickers every 7 seconds and the other light flickers every 8 seconds. How many seconds until both lights will flicker at the same time again?", "qid": "1840", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the common multiple of 7 and 8. The common multiple of 7 and 8 is 56.\n\nNow, we can find the number of seconds between the two flickering times by dividing the common multiple by the least common multiple of the two numbers. The least common multiple of 7 and 8 is 56.\n\n56 seconds / 7 seconds = 8 times\n56 seconds / 8 seconds = 7 times\n\nSince the lights flickered at the same time, we can add the time it takes for both lights to flicker at the same time.\n\n8 seconds + 7 seconds = 15 seconds\n\nThe answer is 15 seconds.", "answer": 56, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1840.png"}
