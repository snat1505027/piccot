{"question": "At Billy's Restaurant a group with two adults and five children came in to eat. If each meal cost three dollars, how much was the bill?", "qid": "1998", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the meal for the group. The image shows that the number of people in the group is 7, and the cost per meal is $3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of meals required for the group. Since there are two adults and five children, we can find the total number of meals by adding the number of adults and children:\n\n2 adults + 5 children = 7 meals\n\nNext, we multiply the total number of meals by the cost per meal to find the total cost of the meal:\n\n7 meals \\* $3 per meal = $<<7*3=21>>21\n\nThe answer is $21.", "answer": 21, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1998.png"}
