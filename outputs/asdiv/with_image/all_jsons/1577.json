{"question": "While playing basketball Team A scored 18 points. If each person scored 2 points, how many people were playing?", "qid": "1577", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people playing on Team A. We know that Team A scored 18 points, and each person scored 2 points. We can use the information from the image to find the number of people playing.\n\nIn the image, there are two boxes with the number 2 in them. This suggests that each person scored 2 points. We can use this information to find the number of people playing.\n\nLet's assume there are x people playing on Team A. Since each person scored 2 points, the total number of points scored by Team A would be 2x. We know that Team A scored 18 points, so we can set up the equation:\n\n2x = 18\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 9\n\nTherefore, there are 9 people playing on Team A.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1577.png"}
