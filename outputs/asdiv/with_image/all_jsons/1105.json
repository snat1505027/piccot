{"question": "Packages of cheddar cheese come with 12 slices, while packages of Swiss cheese come with 28 slices. If Randy bought the same number of slices of each type of cheese, what is the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought?", "qid": "1105", "response": "To find the smallest number of slices of each type of cheese that Randy could have bought, we need to find the smallest common multiple of 12 and 28. The smallest common multiple of 12 and 28 is 28.\n\nThe smallest number of slices of cheddar cheese that Randy could have bought is 28/12 = 2.33. Since Randy could not have bought a fraction of a slice, the smallest number of slices of cheddar cheese that Randy could have bought is 2.\n\nThe smallest number of slices of Swiss cheese that Randy could have bought is 28/28 = 1.\n\nThe answer is 2 slices of cheddar cheese and 1 slice of Swiss cheese.", "answer": 84, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1105.png"}
