{"question": "Carmen is creating lollipop bouquets using 4 cherry lollipops and 6 orange lollipops. She wants each bouquet to be identical, with no lollipops left over. What is the greatest number of lollipop bouquets Carmen can create?", "qid": "1080", "response": "To create the greatest number of lollipop bouquets, Carmen needs to use all the cherry and orange lollipops without any leftovers. She can do this by dividing the total number of lollipops by the number of cherry lollipops.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of lollipops. There are 4 cherry lollipops and 6 orange lollipops, so the total number of lollipops is 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of lollipops by the number of cherry lollipops to find the greatest number of bouquets. There are 4 cherry lollipops, so we divide 10 by 4:\n\n10 \u00f7 4 = 2.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bouquet, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. The greatest number of lollipop bouquets Carmen can create is 2.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1080.png"}
