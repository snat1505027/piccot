{"question": "Lizzie lives in a very big and polluted city. Being an advocate for the environment, she organized a cleanup drive to help reduce the pollution. They started by cleaning the rivers that flow through and around the city. If her group was able to collect 387 pounds of garbage and another group gathered 39 pounds less than Lizzie's group, how much garbage were the two groups able to gather?", "qid": "330", "response": "The first group collected 387 pounds of garbage. The second group collected 39 pounds less than the first group, which means they collected 387 - 39 = 348 pounds of garbage.\n\nThe total amount of garbage gathered by both groups is 387 + 348 = 735 pounds.\n\nThe answer is 735 pounds.", "answer": 735, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/330.png"}
