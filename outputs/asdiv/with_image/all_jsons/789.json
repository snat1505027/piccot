{"question": "A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?", "qid": "789", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chairs each classroom will have if we distribute the 1,093 chairs equally among the 35 classrooms.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the average number of chairs per classroom. To do this, we divide the total number of chairs by the number of classrooms:\n\n1,093 chairs \u00f7 35 classrooms = 31 chairs per classroom\n\nNow, we need to find out how many chairs each classroom should have according to the school's requirements. The image shows that the school requires 35 chairs per classroom.\n\nTo find the difference between the average number of chairs per classroom and the required number of chairs per classroom, we subtract the average number of chairs from the required number of chairs:\n\n35 chairs per classroom - 31 chairs per classroom = 4 chairs per classroom\n\nSince the school requires 4 chairs per classroom more than the average number of chairs, we need to add 4 chairs to each classroom to meet the school's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the school should purchase 4 chairs per classroom, which is 140 chairs in total (4 chairs x 35 classrooms).\n\nThe answer is 140 chairs.", "answer": 27, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/789.png"}
