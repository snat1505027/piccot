{"question": "In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 3 points. If a level has 6 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?", "qid": "2035", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of points earned by defeating the remaining two enemies. We know that each enemy defeated gives 3 points, so we can calculate the points earned by dividing the number of enemies defeated by 3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of enemies defeated. Since there are 6 enemies in total, and you have defeated all but 2 of them, we can find the number of enemies defeated by subtracting 2 from 6:\n\n6 enemies - 2 enemies = 4 enemies defeated\n\nNext, we can calculate the points earned by dividing the number of enemies defeated by 3:\n\n4 enemies defeated / 3 points per enemy = 1.33 points earned\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a point, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up to 2 points, as it is the closest whole number.\n\nThe answer is 2 points.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2035.png"}
