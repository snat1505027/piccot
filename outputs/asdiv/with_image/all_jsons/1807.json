{"question": "Matthew goes hiking every 12 days and swimming every 6 days. He did both kinds of exercise today. How many days from now will he go both hiking and swimming again? ", "qid": "1807", "response": "To find the number of days from now when Matthew will go both hiking and swimming again, we need to find the common multiple of 12 and 6.\n\nFirst, we multiply 12 by 6: 12 x 6 = 72.\n\nNext, we find the smallest multiple of 72 that is greater than 12 and 6. The smallest multiple of 72 is 72, which is greater than both 12 and 6.\n\nTherefore, Matthew will go both hiking and swimming again in 72 days from now.\n\nThe answer is 72.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1807.png"}
