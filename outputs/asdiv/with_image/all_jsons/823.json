{"question": "Ethan and Frank went rowing. Ethan rowed the boat from 10:50 to 11:15. Frank rowed the boat twice as long. How long did the boys row the boat altogether?", "qid": "823", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total time that Ethan and Frank rowed the boat together. We can do this by adding the time Ethan rowed and the time Frank rowed.\n\nEthan rowed the boat from 10:50 to 11:15, which is 25 minutes.\n\nFrank rowed the boat twice as long as Ethan, so he rowed for 25 minutes \\* 2 = 50 minutes.\n\nNow, we can add the time Ethan and Frank rowed together to find the total time: 25 minutes + 50 minutes = 75 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 75 minutes.", "answer": 75, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/823.png"}
