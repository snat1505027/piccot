{"question": "Nathan is stocking bathrooms at the hotel where he works. He has 18 rolls of toilet paper and 9 bars of soap. If he wants all bathrooms to be stocked identically, with the same combination of supplies in each one and nothing left over, what is the greatest combination of bathrooms Nathan can stock? ", "qid": "1812", "response": "To find the greatest combination of bathrooms Nathan can stock, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 9. The GCD of 18 and 9 is 1.\n\nSince the GCD of 18 and 9 is 1, Nathan can stock 1 roll of toilet paper and 1 bar of soap in each bathroom.\n\nThe answer is 1 roll of toilet paper and 1 bar of soap.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1812.png"}
