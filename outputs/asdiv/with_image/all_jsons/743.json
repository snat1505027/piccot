{"question": "Tom had $19 and he wanted to buy as many folders as he could. If one folder costs $2, how much is left after he bought the folders?", "qid": "743", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of folders Tom can buy with $19. We can do this by dividing the amount of money by the cost of each folder.\n\n19 / 2 = 9.5\n\nSince Tom has $19 and the cost of each folder is $2, he can buy 9 folders.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much money is left after Tom buys the folders. To do this, we can subtract the cost of the folders from the initial amount of money.\n\n19 - 9 \\* 2 = 19 - 18 = 1\n\nThere is only $1 left after Tom buys the folders.\n\nThe answer is $1.", "answer": 1, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/743.png"}
