{"question": "Before lunch a waitress had already earned $5 in tips. After lunch she had 7 customers and each customer gave her a 2 dollar tip. How much money did she earn total?", "qid": "1889", "response": "The waitress had already earned $5 in tips before lunch. After lunch, she had 7 customers, and each customer gave her a 2 dollar tip. To find the total amount of money she earned, we need to add the amount she earned before lunch to the amount she earned from the 7 customers.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total amount of tips she received from the 7 customers. We can do this by multiplying the number of customers by the amount of tip each customer gave her: 7 customers x $2 tip = $<<7*2=14>>14.\n\nNext, we add the amount she earned before lunch to the total amount of tips she received from the 7 customers: $5 + $14 = $<<5+14=19>>19.\n\nThe answer is $19.", "answer": 19, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1889.png"}
