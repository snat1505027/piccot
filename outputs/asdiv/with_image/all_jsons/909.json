{"question": "A family is preparing backpacks filled with school supplies to donate to children in need. They have 9 pencils and 15 notebooks. If they want to make all the backpacks the same, with no school supplies left over, what is the greatest number of backpacks they can fill?", "qid": "909", "response": "To find the greatest number of backpacks they can fill, we need to find the total number of school supplies they have and divide it by the number of supplies in each backpack.\n\nFirst, we add the number of pencils and notebooks: 9 + 15 = 24.\n\nNext, we divide the total number of supplies by the number of supplies in each backpack: 24 \u00f7 9 = 2.67.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a backpack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of backpacks. Therefore, the greatest number of backpacks they can fill is 3.\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/909.png"}
