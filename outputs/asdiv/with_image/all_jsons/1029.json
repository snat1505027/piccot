{"question": "Andrew and Jeffrey walk together. When the ratio of Andrew's steps to Jeffrey's steps was 3:4. If Andrew walks 150 steps, how many steps does Jeffrey walk?", "qid": "1029", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of steps Jeffrey takes when Andrew takes 150 steps. We know that the ratio of Andrew's steps to Jeffrey's steps is 3:4.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of Jeffrey's steps when Andrew takes 150 steps. We can do this by dividing 150 by 3, which gives us 50.\n\nNext, we need to multiply the number of Jeffrey's steps by 4 to find the total number of steps Jeffrey takes. 50 x 4 = 200.\n\nThe answer is 200.", "answer": 200, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1029.png"}
