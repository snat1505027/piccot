{"question": "At the movie theatre, they give out a free drink to every 75th customer and a free bag of popcorn to every 30th customer. On Monday 3,000 customers came to the theatre. How many people received both free items?", "qid": "1862", "response": "To find the number of customers who received both free items, we need to find the number of customers who are 75th and 30th at the same time.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of customers who are 75th. We can do this by dividing the total number of customers by 75 and then rounding up to the nearest whole number.\n\n3,000 customers / 75 customers per 75th customer = 40 whole numbers of 75th customers.\n\nSince there are 3,000 customers, and we rounded up to the nearest whole number, the actual number of 75th customers is 41.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of customers who are 30th. We can do this by dividing the total number of customers by 30 and then rounding up to the nearest whole number.\n\n3,000 customers / 30 customers per 30th customer = 100 whole numbers of 30th customers.\n\nSince there are 3,000 customers, and we rounded up to the nearest whole number, the actual number of 30th customers is 101.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of the 41st and 101st customers. To do this, we can subtract 41 from 101 and then add 75 to the result.\n\n101st customer - 41st customer = 60\n60th customer + 75th customer = 135th customer\n\nSo, the number of customers who received both free items is 135th.\n\nThe answer is 135.", "answer": 20, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1862.png"}
