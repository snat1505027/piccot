{"question": "Marian baked bread, cookies and pastries one Saturday at home for her family and friends this holiday season. She made 47 gingerbread cookies which she will distribute equally in tiny glass jars. If each jar is to contain six cookies each, how many cookies will not be placed in a jar?", "qid": "470", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of cookies that will be placed in jars. We know that Marian baked 47 cookies, and each jar will contain six cookies. So, we can calculate the total number of cookies in jars by dividing the number of cookies by the number of cookies per jar:\n\n47 cookies \u00f7 6 cookies per jar = 7.83 jars\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a jar, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of jars. This means that we will have 8 jars containing 6 cookies each.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of cookies that will not be placed in a jar. To do this, we can subtract the total number of cookies in jars from the total number of cookies Marian baked:\n\n47 cookies - (8 jars \u00d7 6 cookies per jar) = 47 cookies - 48 cookies = -1 cookie\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of cookies, we can conclude that Marian will place all 47 cookies in jars, and there will be no cookies left over. The answer is 0.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/470.png"}
