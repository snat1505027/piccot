{"question": "A store owner had six employees and bought five hundred eighty-three uniforms for them. If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?", "qid": "1395", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of uniforms needed for each employee. First, we need to find the total number of uniforms needed for all employees. We can do this by multiplying the number of employees by the number of uniforms per employee.\n\nNumber of employees = 6\nNumber of uniforms per employee = 583\n\nTotal number of uniforms needed = 6 x 583 = 3,538\n\nSince the store owner already has 583 uniforms, he needs to buy 3,538 - 583 = 3,955 more uniforms to ensure that each employee gets the same number of uniforms without any extra.\n\nThe answer is 3,955.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1395.png"}
