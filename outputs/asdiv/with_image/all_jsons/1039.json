{"question": "In 3 seconds, Kevin can dribble a basketball 13 times. If Kevin dribbles at this same rate for 27 seconds, how many times will he dribble the basketball?", "qid": "1039", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of dribbles Kevin can do in 27 seconds. We know that he can dribble 13 times in 3 seconds, so we can find the number of dribbles per second by dividing 13 by 3.\n\n13 dribbles in 3 seconds \u00f7 3 seconds per dribble = 4.33 dribbles per second\n\nNow, we can find the number of dribbles in 27 seconds by multiplying the number of dribbles per second by the total time in seconds.\n\n4.33 dribbles per second \u00d7 27 seconds = 120.61 dribbles in 27 seconds\n\nThe answer is 120.61.", "answer": 117, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1039.png"}
