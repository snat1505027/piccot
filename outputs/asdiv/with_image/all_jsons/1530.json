{"question": "Paul was packing up his old toys. He managed to squeeze eight toys into a box. If Paul filled up four boxes, how many toys did he pack total?", "qid": "1530", "response": "First, we need to find out how many toys Paul packed in each box. Since he managed to fit eight toys into one box, we can assume that he packed the same number of toys in each of the four boxes.\n\nSo, the number of toys in each box is eight.\n\nNext, we need to find out the total number of toys Paul packed. Since he filled up four boxes, we can multiply the number of toys in each box by the number of boxes.\n\n8 toys per box \\* 4 boxes = 32 toys\n\nThe answer is 32 toys.", "answer": 32, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1530.png"}
