{"question": "Susie and her family woke up early on the first weekend of spring. They had a long list of activities for spring cleaning. Susie's mom prepared 74 carrot sticks for breakfast. If the carrots were served equally to 12 people, how many carrot sticks were left uneaten?", "qid": "475", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of carrot sticks left uneaten. First, we need to find out how many carrot sticks were served to each person. We know that there are 74 carrot sticks and 12 people. To find the number of carrot sticks per person, we can divide the total number of carrot sticks by the number of people:\n\n74 carrot sticks \u00f7 12 people = 6 carrot sticks per person\n\nNow, we need to find the number of carrot sticks left uneaten. To do this, we can subtract the number of carrot sticks served from the total number of carrot sticks:\n\n74 carrot sticks - 6 carrot sticks per person = 68 carrot sticks left uneaten\n\nThe answer is 68 carrot sticks left uneaten.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/475.png"}
