We know that the ratio of shoes to sandals is 9:5, and we have the number of shoes sold, which is 72. To find the number of sandals sold, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Multiply the number of shoes sold by the ratio of shoes to sandals (9:5).\n2. Divide the result by the number of shoes in the ratio (5).\n\nThe answer is 72 x (9/5) = 72 x 1.8 = 129.6. To find the exact number of sandals sold, we need to round the result to the nearest whole number. The answer is 129 sandals sold.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1510.png"}
