{"question": "A rectangle has an area of 360 square centimeters. It is 20 centimeters long. What is its perimeter?", "qid": "1349", "response": "To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we need to use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nFirst, we need to find the width of the rectangle. We know that the area of the rectangle is 360 square centimeters, and the length is 20 centimeters. We can use the formula A = LW to find the width:\n\n360 = 20W\n\nW = 360 / 20\n\nW = 18\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the perimeter:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nP = 2(20) + 2(18)\n\nP = 40 + 36\n\nP = 76\n\nThe answer is 76.", "answer": 76, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1349.png"}
