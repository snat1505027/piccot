According to the report, how many minutes total do people spend on Youtube?", "qid": "1899", "response": "To find the total minutes spent on Youtube, we need to calculate the time spent watching videos and the time spent watching ads.\n\n1. Average videos watched per day: 2\n2. Average video length: 7 minutes\n\nTo find the total time spent watching videos, we multiply the number of videos watched per day by the average video length:\n2 videos/day \\* 7 minutes/video = 14 minutes/day\n\n1. Average ads watched per day: 3\n\nTo find the total time spent watching ads, we multiply the number of ads watched per day by the average ad length:\n3 ads/day \\* 3 minutes/ad = 9 minutes/day\n\nNow, we add the total time spent watching videos and the total time spent watching ads to find the total time spent on Youtube:\n14 minutes/day + 9 minutes/day = 23 minutes/day\n\nThe answer is 23 minutes.", "answer": 17, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1899.png"}
