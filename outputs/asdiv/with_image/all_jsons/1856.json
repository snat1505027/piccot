{"question": "There are less than 6 dozen eggs in a basket. If the eggs are counted 2, 3, 4, or 5 at a time, there are none left over. How many eggs are there in the basket?", "qid": "1856", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of eggs that can be counted in groups of 2, 3, 4, or 5 without any left over. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs by each of these numbers and rounding down to the nearest whole number.\n\n1. 2 dozen eggs: 24 eggs \u00f7 2 = 12 eggs. There are 12 eggs left over.\n2. 3 dozen eggs: 36 eggs \u00f7 3 = 12 eggs. There are 12 eggs left over.\n3. 4 dozen eggs: 48 eggs \u00f7 4 = 12 eggs. There are 12 eggs left over.\n4. 5 dozen eggs: 60 eggs \u00f7 5 = 12 eggs. There are 12 eggs left over.\n\nSince there are no eggs left over when counting in groups of 2, 3, 4, or 5, the number of eggs in the basket must be a multiple of 12. The possible numbers are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180, 192, 204, 216, 228, 240, 252, 264, 276, 288, 300, 312, 324, 336, 348, 360, 372, 384, 400, 416, 432, 448, 464, 480, 500, 512, 524, 536, 552, 568, 584, 600, 616, 632, 648, 664, 680, 700, 720, 740, 760, 780, 800", "answer": 60, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1856.png"}
