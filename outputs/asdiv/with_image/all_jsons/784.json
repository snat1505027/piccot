{"question": "A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?", "qid": "784", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of books per shelf. First, we need to find the average number of books per shelf. We can do this by dividing the total number of new books by the total number of shelves.\n\n4,305 new books \u00f7 83 shelves = 51.83 books per shelf\n\nSince the number of books per shelf is not an integer, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n51.83 books per shelf \u2248 52 books per shelf\n\nNow, we need to find the number of new books required to fill the remaining shelves. We can do this by subtracting the number of books already purchased from the total number of books per shelf.\n\n52 books per shelf - 51.83 books per shelf = 0.17 books per shelf\n\nTo find the total number of new books required, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf.\n\n0.17 books per shelf \u00d7 83 shelves = 14.51 new books\n\nThe answer is 14.51 new books.", "answer": 11, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/784.png"}
