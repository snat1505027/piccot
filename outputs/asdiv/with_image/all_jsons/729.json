{"question": "A box can hold 18 pieces of chalk. If there are 3,484 pieces of chalk, how many chalks are there in the box that is not full?", "qid": "729", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to hold all the chalk pieces.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of chalk pieces that can fit in a single box.\n\n18 pieces of chalk can fit in a single box.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to hold all the chalk pieces.\n\n3,484 pieces of chalk divided by 18 pieces per box:\n\n3,484 \u00f7 18 = 193 boxes\n\n3. Finally, we need to find out how many chalk pieces are in the box that is not full.\n\nSince there are 193 boxes, and the box is not full, it means that there are fewer chalk pieces in the box than the maximum capacity of 18 pieces.\n\nThe answer is 193 boxes with fewer chalk pieces than the maximum capacity.", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/729.png"}
