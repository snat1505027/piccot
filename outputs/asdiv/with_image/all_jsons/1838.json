{"question": "Rafaela is a physical education teacher and has 25 girls and 35 boys in her class. She wants to divide the class into teams of the same size, where each team has the same number of girls and the same number of boys. If Rafaela creates the greatest number of teams possible, how many boys will be on each team?", "qid": "1838", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest number of teams that can be created with the given number of girls and boys. We can do this by first finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and boys.\n\nGCD(25, 35) = 1\n\nSince the GCD is 1, we can create one team with 1 boy and 1 girl. To create more teams, we need to find the smallest number that can be divided evenly between the two teams.\n\nSmallest common multiple (SCM) = 25 \\* 35 = 875\n\nSince the SCM is 875, we can create 875 / 25 = 35 teams with 1 boy and 1 girl on each team.\n\nThe answer is 35.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1838.png"}
