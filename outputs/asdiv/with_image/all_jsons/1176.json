{"question": "George is 8 years more than Christopher and Ford is 2 years younger than Christopher. The sum of their ages is 60. Find the ages of George, Christopher and Ford.", "qid": "1176", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. George is 8 years more than Christopher, so we can write:\n\nGeorge's age = Christopher's age + 8\n\nNext, we know that Ford is 2 years younger than Christopher, so we can write:\n\nFord's age = Christopher's age - 2\n\nNow, we have the following equation:\n\nGeorge's age + Ford's age = 60\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for George's age and Ford's age into this equation:\n\n(Christopher's age + 8) + (Christopher's age - 2) = 60\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2 Christopher's age = 58\n\nNow, we can find Christopher's age:\n\nChristopher's age = 29\n\nNow, we can find George's age:\n\nGeorge's age = Christopher's age + 8 = 37\n\nFinally, we can find Ford's age:\n\nFord's age = Christopher's age - 2 = 27\n\nThe answer is:\nGeorge's age = 37\nChristopher's age = 29\nFord's age = 27", "answer": 26, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1176.png"}
