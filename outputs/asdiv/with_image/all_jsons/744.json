{"question": "86 students are going hiking. Each school- bus can take 9 students. How many school-buses are needed?", "qid": "744", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of school buses needed to transport the 86 students. Since each school bus can take 9 students, we can divide the number of students by the number of students per bus.\n\n86 students / 9 students per bus = <<86/9=9.55>>9.55\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of buses.\n\nThe answer is 10 school buses.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/744.png"}
