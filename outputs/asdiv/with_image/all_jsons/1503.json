{"question": "During a race Gwen jogged for 15 minutes. If the ratio of time she jogged to time she walked was 5:3, how many minutes did Gwen walk?", "qid": "1503", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the time Gwen walked. We know that she jogged for 15 minutes, and the ratio of time jogged to time walked is 5:3. Let's start by finding the time she walked.\n\n1. First, we need to find the time she walked in terms of the ratio.\n\nRatio: 5:3\n\nWe can simplify the ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 15.\n\nRatio: 3:2\n\n1. Now, we can find the time she walked by multiplying the time she jogged by the ratio.\n\nTime jogged: 15 minutes\n\nTime walked: 15 minutes \\* 3/2 = 15/2 minutes = 7.5 minutes\n\nThe answer is 7.5 minutes.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1503.png"}
