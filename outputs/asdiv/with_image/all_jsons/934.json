{"question": "William sells hot dogs at the ball park. He sold 19 hot dogs during the first three innings. He sold 27 hot dogs during the next three innings. William had 45 hot dogs left to sell. How many hot dogs did William have at first?", "qid": "934", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hot dogs William had at the beginning. We can do this by adding the number of hot dogs he sold during the first three innings and the next three innings.\n\n19 hot dogs sold during the first three innings + 27 hot dogs sold during the next three innings = 46 hot dogs sold in total.\n\nSince William had 45 hot dogs left to sell, we can conclude that he had 45 + 46 = 91 hot dogs at the beginning.\n\nThe answer is 91.", "answer": 91, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/934.png"}
