{"question": "Mrs. Walker will have 56 apples for bobbing for apples. Each bucket will hold 9 apples. How many buckets will she need?", "qid": "562", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of buckets needed to hold 56 apples, assuming each bucket holds 9 apples.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of apples that can be held in one bucket. To do this, we multiply the number of apples per bucket by the number of buckets needed:\n\n56 apples / 9 apples per bucket = 6.2222... buckets\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bucket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of buckets. In this case, we need 7 buckets to hold all the apples.\n\nThe answer is 7 buckets.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/562.png"}
