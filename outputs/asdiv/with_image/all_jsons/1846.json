{"question": "Jason and Lexi are shelving books at a public library. Jason shelves 6 books at a time, whereas Lexi shelves 17 at a time. If they end up shelving the same number of books, what is the smallest number of books each could have shelved?", "qid": "1846", "response": "To find the smallest number of books each could have shelved, we need to find the smallest common multiple of 6 and 17. The smallest common multiple of 6 and 17 is 102.\n\nTo find the smallest number of books each could have shelved, we can divide 102 by 6 and 17.\n\n102 \u00f7 6 = 17\n102 \u00f7 17 = 6\n\nSo, the smallest number of books each could have shelved is 6 books.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 102, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1846.png"}
