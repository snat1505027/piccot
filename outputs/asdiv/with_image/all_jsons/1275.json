Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age.\n2. One son is two years older than the other.\n3. The sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age.\n\nLet's represent the father's age as 3x, the age of the older son as 2x + 2, and the age of the younger son as 2x - 2.\n\n1. Ten years ago, the sum of the sons' ages was 3x/3.\n2. The difference in their ages is 2.\n3. The sum of their present ages is 3x - 2(2x + 2) = 3x - 4x - 4 = -x - 4.\n\nNow, we can solve the equation:\n\n3x - 2(2x + 2) = -x - 4\n\n3x - 4x - 4 = -x - 4\n-x = -4x - 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (4x + 4) + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x + 4\n\nx = 4x + 4\nx = 4x +", "answer": 21, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1275.png"}
