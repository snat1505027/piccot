{"question": "Each side of a square kitchen tile is 7 inches long. What is the tile's area?", "qid": "1371", "response": "To find the area of the square kitchen tile, we need to calculate the square of the side length. The side length of the tile is 7 inches.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the side length from inches to square inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, and 144 square inches in a square foot. So, 7 inches is equal to 7/12 of a square foot, or 5.8333 square inches.\n\nNext, we square the side length to find the area of the tile. 5.8333 squared is equal to 34.0001 square inches.\n\nThe answer is 34.0001 square inches.", "answer": 49, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1371.png"}
