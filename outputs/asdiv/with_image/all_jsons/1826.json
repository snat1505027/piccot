What is the smallest total number of hot dogs that Yadira's mom can purchase?", "qid": "1826", "response": "To find the smallest total number of hot dogs, we need to find the smallest multiple of 9 that is equal to or greater than 12. We can do this by dividing 12 by 9 and then rounding up to the nearest integer.\n\n12 \u00f7 9 = 1.333...\n\nRounding up to the nearest integer, we get 2.\n\nSo, the smallest total number of hot dogs that Yadira's mom can purchase is 2.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1826.png"}
