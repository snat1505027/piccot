{"question": "A movie store had nine hundred ninety-nine movies they were putting on five shelves. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?", "qid": "1416", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of movies per shelf. We can do this by dividing the total number of movies by the number of shelves.\n\n999 movies \u00f7 5 shelves = 199.8 movies per shelf\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a movie, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n199.8 movies per shelf \u2248 200 movies per shelf\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more movies the owner would need to ensure each shelf has the same number of movies.\n\n200 movies per shelf - 999 movies \u00f7 5 shelves = 199.8 movies per shelf = 200 movies per shelf\n\nThe owner would need 1 movie to make each shelf have the same number of movies.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 1, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1416.png"}
