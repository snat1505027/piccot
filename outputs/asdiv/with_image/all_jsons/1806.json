{"question": "Serena wants to create snack bags for a trip she is going on. She has 6 granola bars and 10 pieces of dried fruit. If the snack bags should be identical without any food left over, what is the greatest number of snack bags Serena can make? ", "qid": "1806", "response": "To find the greatest number of snack bags Serena can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the given numbers.\n\n6 granola bars and 10 pieces of dried fruit can be represented as follows:\n\n6 granola bars = 6G\n10 pieces of dried fruit = 10D\n\nTo find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n6G - 4 = 2G\n2G - 2 = 0\n\nSo, the GCD of 6 and 10 is 2.\n\nSince Serena has 2 granola bars and 2 pieces of dried fruit left over, she can make the greatest number of snack bags by dividing the total number of granola bars and dried fruit by the GCD:\n\n6G / 2 = 3\n10D / 2 = 5\n\nSerena can make a total of 3 snack bags containing granola bars and 5 snack bags containing dried fruit.\n\nThe answer is 3 snack bags containing granola bars and 5 snack bags containing dried fruit.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1806.png"}
