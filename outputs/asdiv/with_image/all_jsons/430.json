{"question": "Amanda and her friends decided to go to an amusement park for the weekend. The nearest amusement park from their city is Super Fun-tastic Land. If they cover a distance of 27 miles for every hour of travel and they travelled for 3 hours, how far is SFL from the city?", "qid": "430", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the distance from the city to SFL. We know that Amanda and her friends traveled for 3 hours and covered a distance of 27 miles per hour. We can use this information to find the total distance they traveled.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total distance they traveled by multiplying the number of hours they traveled by the distance they covered per hour:\n\n3 hours \\* 27 miles/hour = 81 miles\n\nNow, we need to find the distance from the city to SFL. We know that the distance from the city to SFL is equal to the total distance they traveled minus the distance they traveled in the last hour. Since they traveled for 3 hours, the distance they traveled in the last hour is 27 miles/hour \\* 3 hours = 81 miles.\n\nTherefore, the distance from the city to SFL is:\n\n81 miles - 81 miles = 0 miles\n\nThe answer is 0 miles.", "answer": 81, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/430.png"}
