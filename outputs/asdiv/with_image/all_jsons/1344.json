{"question": "Doug built a tent in the shape of a regular pentagon. Its perimeter is 60 feet. What is the length of each side of the tent?", "qid": "1344", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each side of the tent. We know that the perimeter of the tent is 60 feet. We can use the formula for the perimeter of a regular pentagon to find the length of each side.\n\nPerimeter of a regular pentagon = (5 x side length) + 5 x side length\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for the side length:\n\nSide length = (Perimeter - 5 x side length) / 5\n\nPlugging in the given perimeter of 60 feet, we get:\n\nSide length = (60 - 5 x side length) / 5\n\nNow, we can solve for side length:\n\nSide length = (60 - 5x) / 5\n\nSide length = 12 feet\n\nThe answer is 12 feet.", "answer": 12, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1344.png"}
