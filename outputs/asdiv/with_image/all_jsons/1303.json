{"question": "At present a father is three times as old as his son. After 12 years his age will be twice the age of his son. Find their present ages?", "qid": "1303", "response": "First, we need to find the number of years that have passed since the father and son were the same age. We can do this by looking at the number of years between the two ages in the image.\n\nThe image shows that the father is currently three times as old as his son. After 12 years, the father's age will be twice the age of his son.\n\nSo, we can find the number of years between their present ages by looking at the number of years between the age of the father after 12 years and the son's current age.\n\nThe father's age after 12 years will be twice the age of his son, so we can find the number of years by dividing the difference in their ages by 2.\n\nThe son's age is 12 years younger than the father's age, so we can find the number of years by adding 12 to the number of years between their present ages.\n\nThe answer is 12.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1303.png"}
