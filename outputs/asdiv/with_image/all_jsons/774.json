{"question": "Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many baskets of apples are there?", "qid": "774", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of baskets of apples. We know that Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and packed them evenly in some baskets. We also know that there are 25 apples in each basket.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of apples in one basket. To do this, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each basket:\n\n495 apples \u00f7 25 apples per basket = 19.8 apples per basket\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of apples per basket. This gives us 20 apples per basket.\n\nNow, we can find the number of baskets of apples by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per basket:\n\n495 apples \u00f7 20 apples per basket = 24.75 baskets of apples\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a basket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of baskets. This gives us 25 baskets of apples.\n\nThe answer is 25 baskets of apples.", "answer": 19, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/774.png"}
