{"question": "Each CD rack holds 8 CDs. A shelf can hold four racks. How many total CDs can fit on the shelf?", "qid": "127", "response": "First, we need to find out how many shelves can fit on the rack. Since each rack can hold 8 CDs, and a shelf can hold 4 racks, we can calculate the number of shelves that can fit on the rack by dividing the number of CDs by the number of CDs per rack.\n\n8 CDs \u00f7 8 CDs per rack = 1 rack\n\nNow, we know that one shelf can hold four racks. So, to find out how many shelves can fit on the rack, we can divide the number of racks by the number of racks per shelf.\n\n1 rack \u00f7 4 racks per shelf = 0.25 shelves\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of shelves.\n\n0.25 shelves rounded up to the nearest whole number = 1 shelf\n\nNow, we know that one shelf can hold four racks, and each rack can hold 8 CDs. So, to find out the total number of CDs that can fit on the shelf, we can multiply the number of racks per shelf by the number of CDs per rack.\n\n4 racks per shelf \u00d7 8 CDs per rack = 32 CDs\n\nThe answer is 32 CDs.", "answer": 32, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/127.png"}
