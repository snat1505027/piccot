{"question": "Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?", "qid": "1265", "response": "Let's start by finding the number of heaps for each boy.\n\nFor the boy with 6-marble heaps, we can find the number of marbles in each heap by dividing the total number of marbles by 6.\n\n480 marbles \u00f7 6 marbles per heap = 80 heaps of 6 marbles\n\nFor the boy with 9-marble heaps, we can find the number of marbles in each heap by dividing the total number of marbles by 9.\n\n480 marbles \u00f7 9 marbles per heap = 53 heaps of 9 marbles\n\nNow, we can find the total number of heaps for both boys by adding the number of heaps for each boy.\n\n80 heaps of 6 marbles + 53 heaps of 9 marbles = 133 heaps\n\nSince the total number of heaps is 72, we can find the number of marbles each boy has by dividing the total number of marbles by the total number of heaps.\n\n480 marbles \u00f7 133 heaps = 3.63 marbles per heap\n\nSince we know that each heap contains 6 or 9 marbles, we can find the number of marbles each boy has by multiplying the number of heaps by the number of marbles in each heap.\n\nFor the boy with 6-marble heaps:\n\n80 heaps \u00d7 6 marbles per heap = 480 marbles\n\nFor the boy with 9-marble heaps:\n\n53 heaps \u00d7 9 marbles per heap = 481 marbles\n\nThe answer is 481 marbles for the boy with 9-marble heaps and 480 marbles for the boy with 6-marble heaps.", "answer": 336, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1265.png"}
