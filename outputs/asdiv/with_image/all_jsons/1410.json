{"question": "A box of computer paper has two hundred twenty-one sheets left in it. If each printer in a computer lab needed seven sheets, how many printers would the box fill up?", "qid": "1410", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many printers the box of computer paper can fill up. We know that there are 221 sheets left in the box and each printer needs 7 sheets.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many sheets are in the box. We can do this by dividing the total number of sheets by the number of sheets needed by each printer:\n\n221 sheets \u00f7 7 sheets/printer = 31.857142857 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a printer, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of printers. In this case, we can round up to 32 printers.\n\nThe answer is 32 printers.", "answer": 31, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1410.png"}
