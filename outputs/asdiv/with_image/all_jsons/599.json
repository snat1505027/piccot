{"question": "Mrs. Hilt uses 2 ounces of detergent to wash a pound of clothes. How many ounces of soap will she use to wash 9 pounds of clothes?", "qid": "599", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the amount of detergent and the amount of soap needed for washing clothes. We can start by looking at the given information:\n\n1. Mrs. Hilt uses 2 ounces of detergent to wash a pound of clothes.\n2. We need to find the amount of soap needed to wash 9 pounds of clothes.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the pound of clothes to ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound. So, 1 pound of clothes is equal to 16 ounces.\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion to find the relationship between the amount of detergent and the amount of soap needed:\n\n2 ounces of detergent : 16 ounces of clothes\n\nTo find the amount of soap needed for 9 pounds of clothes, we can multiply the proportion by 9:\n\n2 ounces of detergent : 16 ounces of clothes\n9 pounds of clothes : x ounces of soap\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2 ounces of detergent : 16 ounces of clothes\n9 pounds of clothes : x ounces of soap\n\nDivide both sides by 16:\n\n2 ounces of detergent : 16 ounces of clothes\n9 pounds of clothes : x ounces of soap\n\nx = 2 ounces of detergent / 16 ounces of clothes\nx = 0.125 ounces of soap\n\nThe answer is 0.125 ounces of soap.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/599.png"}
