{"question": "The second angle of a triangle is three times the first, and the third is 12 degrees less than twice the first. Find the measures of the angles.", "qid": "1323", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the measures of the angles in the triangle. We are given that the second angle is three times the first, and the third angle is 12 degrees less than twice the first angle.\n\nLet's start by finding the measure of the first angle. We can do this by setting up a proportion:\n\nFirst angle: x\nSecond angle: 3x\nThird angle: 12 degrees less than 2x\n\nWe can simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying:\n\nx \\* 2 = 3x\nx \\* 2 - 3x = 12\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x - 3x = 12\n-x = -12\nx = 12\n\nSo, the first angle is 12 degrees.\n\nNext, we can find the measure of the second angle by using the given information:\n\nSecond angle: 3x\n3x = 3 \\* 12\n3x = 36\nx = 12\n\nSo, the second angle is also 12 degrees.\n\nFinally, we can find the measure of the third angle by using the given information:\n\nThird angle: 12 degrees less than 2x\n12 degrees less than 2 \\* 12\n12 degrees less than 24\n12 = 24 - x\nx = 12\n\nSo, the third angle is also 12 degrees.\n\nThe answer is: The measures of the angles in the triangle are 12, 12, and 12 degrees.", "answer": 32, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1323.png"}
