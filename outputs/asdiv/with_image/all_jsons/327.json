{"question": "To add support on the house's connections, he decided to tie the wood joints with rope. He needs 185 feet of rope. If he has 46 feet of rope with him and at the moment he only needed 57 feet, how many feet of rope did his friends give to him?", "qid": "327", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total feet of rope needed and the feet of rope he has with him. We can then add the feet of rope given by his friends to find the total feet of rope he has.\n\n185 feet of rope needed - 46 feet of rope with him = 139 feet of rope needed\n139 feet of rope needed + 57 feet of rope given by friends = 196 feet of rope\n\nThe answer is 196 feet of rope.", "answer": 82, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/327.png"}
