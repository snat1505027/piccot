{"question": "Allen, Charles, Lex and Shiela spent days reading books for their book report. The texts were printed very small so they were only able to cover very few pages a day. Allen read about the Solar System. He read 10 pages a day of a book which has 120 pages. How many days did it take Allen to finish reading the book?", "qid": "491", "response": "To find out how many days it took Allen to finish reading the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages he read and divide it by the number of pages he read per day.\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many pages Allen read in total. We know that he read 10 pages per day, and the book has 120 pages. So, we can calculate the total number of pages he read by multiplying the number of days he spent reading by the number of pages he read per day:\n\n10 pages/day \\* x days = total pages read\n\n2. Now, we can divide the total number of pages read by the number of pages he read per day to find out how many days it took him to finish reading the book:\n\ntotal pages read / pages read per day = days it took to finish reading the book\n\nThe answer is 12 days.", "answer": 12, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/491.png"}
