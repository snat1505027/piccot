{"question": "A school ordered 195 new pencils for the state tests.

We know that the school ordered 195 pencils and each student received 3 pencils.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of pencils per student. We can do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per student:\n\n195 pencils / 3 pencils per student = 65 students\n\nNow, we can find the number of students in the school by multiplying the number of pencils per student by the total number of pencils:\n\n3 pencils per student \\* 195 pencils = 65 students\n\nThe answer is 65 students.", "answer": 65, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1434.png"}
