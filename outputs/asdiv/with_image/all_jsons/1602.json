{"question": "A group of 8 friends were playing a video game. In the game, each player started with 8 lives. How many lives did they have totaled?", "qid": "1602", "response": "The image shows a math problem with two equations. The first equation is \"Number of friends x Number of lives each friend starts with.\" The second equation is \"Total number of lives.\"\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the value of the total number of lives. We can do this by plugging the values of the first equation into the second equation.\n\nFirst equation: Number of friends x Number of lives each friend starts with\n\nLet's assume the number of friends is 8.\n\n8 x 8 = 64\n\nNow, we can plug the value of 64 into the second equation:\n\nTotal number of lives = Number of friends x Number of lives each friend starts with\n\nTotal number of lives = 64\n\nThe answer is 64.", "answer": 64, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1602.png"}
