{"question": "It has been tradition in Shiela's home to hang a sock above the fireplace for each member of the family. This year, she placed a cinnamon ball every day in the socks for 5 of her family members. How long can she do this if she bought 50 cinnamon balls?", "qid": "454", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days Shiela can hang a cinnamon ball for each family member. We know that she bought 50 cinnamon balls and is hanging one for each of 5 family members.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many cinnamon balls are needed for one family member. Since there are 50 cinnamon balls and 5 family members, we can divide the number of cinnamon balls by the number of family members:\n\n50 cinnamon balls \u00f7 5 family members = 10 cinnamon balls per family member\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days Shiela can hang a cinnamon ball for each family member. Since she is hanging one cinnamon ball per day for 5 family members, we can multiply the number of cinnamon balls per family member by the number of days:\n\n10 cinnamon balls per family member \u00d7 5 family members = 50 cinnamon balls per day\n\nSince Shiela has 50 cinnamon balls, she can hang a cinnamon ball for each family member for 50 days.\n\nThe answer is 50 days.", "answer": 10, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/454.png"}
