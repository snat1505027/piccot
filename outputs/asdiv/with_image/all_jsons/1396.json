{"question": "A grocery store needed eight hundred ten cans of peas. If the peas come in boxes with four cans in each box, how many boxes would they need to order?", "qid": "1396", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes needed to order eight hundred ten cans of peas. Since each box contains four cans, we can start by dividing the total number of cans by the number of cans per box.\n\n800 / 4 = 200\n\nSince the answer is not a whole number, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of boxes.\n\n200 \u2248 200\n\nThe answer is 200 boxes.", "answer": 203, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1396.png"}
