{"question": "There are 95 pretzels in a bowl. John ate 28 pretzels. Alan ate 9 fewer pretzels than John. Marcus ate 12 more pretzels than John. How many pretzels did Marcus eat?", "qid": "872", "response": "First, we need to find out how many pretzels Alan ate. Since Alan ate 9 fewer pretzels than John, we can subtract 9 from 28 to get the number of pretzels Alan ate:\n\n28 - 9 = 19\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pretzels John ate. We know that Marcus ate 12 more pretzels than John, so we can add 12 to the number of pretzels John ate to get the number of pretzels Marcus ate:\n\n12 + 28 = 40\n\nSince we know that there are 95 pretzels in the bowl, we can add the number of pretzels eaten by John, Alan, and Marcus to find the total number of pretzels eaten:\n\n95 + 28 + 40 = 163\n\nThe answer is 163.", "answer": 40, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/872.png"}
