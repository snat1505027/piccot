{"question": "A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many long pieces should be cut for?", "qid": "762", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total length of the rope and the number of long pieces that can be cut from it.\n\n1. The rope is 27 yards long.\n2. The worker needs to cut some long pieces at 4 yards each and some short pieces at 1 yard each.\n\nTo find the total length of the rope, we can add the length of the long pieces and the length of the short pieces.\n\n27 yards (total length) = 4 yards (long pieces) + 1 yard (short pieces)\n\n27 yards = 4 yards + 1 yard\n\n27 yards = 5 yards\n\nSince the total length of the rope is 27 yards and the worker needs to cut 5 yards of long pieces, the worker should cut 27 yards / 5 yards = 5.4 yards of long pieces.\n\nThe answer is 5.4 yards.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/762.png"}
