{"question": "Tess is decorating papers with a total of 45 heart stickers and 27 star stickers for the child she is babysitting. If she wants to make all the papers identical, with the same combination of heart and star stickers and no stickers left over, what is the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate?", "qid": "1073", "response": "To find the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and 27. The GCD of 45 and 27 is 1.\n\nSince Tess has 45 heart stickers and 27 star stickers, she can decorate one page with one heart sticker and one star sticker.\n\nTo find the total number of pages Tess can decorate, we need to divide the total number of stickers by the number of stickers per page.\n\n45 heart stickers + 27 star stickers = 72 stickers in total\n\n72 stickers / (1 heart sticker + 1 star sticker) = 72 / 2 = 36 pages\n\nThe answer is 36.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1073.png"}
