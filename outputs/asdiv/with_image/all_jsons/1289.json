{"question": "Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, and upstream 4 km in 2 hours. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.", "qid": "1289", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. The image shows a series of equations and variables related to Tara's speed and the current.\n\n1. Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, so her speed in still water is 20 km / 2 hours = 10 km/hour.\n2. Tara can row upstream 4 km in 2 hours, so her speed in still water is 4 km / 2 hours = 2 km/hour.\n3. The speed of the current is not given in the image, so we cannot determine it.\n\nThe answer is:\nTara's speed of rowing in still water is 10 km/hour, and the speed of the current is unknown.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1289.png"}
