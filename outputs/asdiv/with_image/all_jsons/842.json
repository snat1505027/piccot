{"question": "A new store opened up at the mall. During the first hour, 94 people came in and 27 people left. During the second hour, 18 people came in and 9 people left. How many people were still in the store after 2 hours?", "qid": "842", "response": "To find the number of people still in the store after 2 hours, we need to calculate the total number of people who entered and left during the first hour and the second hour, and then subtract the number of people who left during both hours from the total number of people who entered during both hours.\n\nDuring the first hour, 94 people came in and 27 people left, so the total number of people in the store during the first hour was 94 + 27 = 121.\n\nDuring the second hour, 18 people came in and 9 people left, so the total number of people in the store during the second hour was 18 + 9 = 27.\n\nTo find the total number of people in the store after 2 hours, we add the number of people in the store during the first hour and the second hour: 121 + 27 = 148.\n\nTo find the number of people still in the store after 2 hours, we subtract the number of people who left during both hours from the total number of people in the store after 2 hours: 148 - (27 + 9) = 148 - 36 = 112.\n\nThe answer is 112.", "answer": 76, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/842.png"}
