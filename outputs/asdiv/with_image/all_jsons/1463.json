{"question": "Adam bought a new flat screen TV with an area of 21 square feets. The screen is 3 feet wide. How tall is it?", "qid": "1463", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the TV. We know that the TV has an area of 21 square feet and a screen width of 3 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the height:\n\nArea = width x height\n\nSince we know the width and want to find the height, we can rearrange the formula to solve for height:\n\nheight = width x area / width^2\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nheight = 3 x 21 / 3^2\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nheight = 3 x 21 / 9\n\nheight = 3.44 feet\n\nThe answer is 3.44 feet.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1463.png"}
