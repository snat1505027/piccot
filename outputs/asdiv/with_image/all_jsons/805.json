{"question": "At the gym, Hillary swims every 6 days, runs every 4 days and cycles every 16 days. If she did all three activities today, in how many days will she do all three activities again on the same day?", "qid": "805", "response": "To find the number of days Hillary will do all three activities again on the same day, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 4, and 16.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of each number:\n6 = 2^2\n4 = 2^2\n16 = 2^4\n\nNext, we multiply the prime factors to find the LCM:\nLCM = 2^2 \\* 2^2 \\* 2^4 = 2^10 = 1024\n\nThe answer is 1024 days.", "answer": 48, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/805.png"}
