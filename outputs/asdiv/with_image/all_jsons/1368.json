{"question": "The perimeter of a rectangular cutting board is 50 inches. It is 10 inches wide. How long is it?", "qid": "1368", "response": "To find the length of the cutting board, we need to use the perimeter formula: P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nWe know that the perimeter is 50 inches, and the width is 10 inches. We can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n50 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to solve for L:\n\n50 - 2W = 2L\n\n50 - 2(10) = 2L\n\n50 - 20 = 2L\n\n30 = 2L\n\nL = 15\n\nThe length of the cutting board is 15 inches.\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1368.png"}
