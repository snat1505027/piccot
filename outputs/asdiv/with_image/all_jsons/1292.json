{"question": "Amy travelled 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, it took him 5 hours 30 minutes. But if he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi he takes 6 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and taxi.", "qid": "1292", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the train and taxi. Let's start by using the given information:\n\n1. Amy travelled 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, taking 5 hours 30 minutes.\n2. If he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi, he takes 6 minutes longer.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total distance travelled by train and taxi in both cases:\n\nCase 1:\nTrain distance: 300 km\nTaxi distance: 200 km\nTotal distance: 300 + 200 = 500 km\n\nCase 2:\nTrain distance: 260 km\nTaxi distance: 240 km\nTotal distance: 260 + 240 = 500 km\n\nSince both cases have the same total distance, we can find the speed of the train and taxi by dividing the total distance by the time taken:\n\nCase 1:\nTrain speed: 500 km / 5 hours 30 minutes = 100 km/h\nTaxi speed: 500 km / 5 hours 30 minutes = 100 km/h\n\nCase 2:\nTrain speed: 500 km / 5 hours 36 minutes = 100 km/h\nTaxi speed: 500 km / 5 hours 36 minutes = 100 km/h\n\nSince both cases have the same speed for both train and taxi, the answer is:\n\nThe train and taxi travel at a speed of 100 km/h.", "answer": 100, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1292.png"}
