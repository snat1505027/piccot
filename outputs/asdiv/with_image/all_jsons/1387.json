{"question": "A container can hold four orange slices. If a company had three hundred twenty-nine orange slices to put into containers, how many more slices would they need to fill up the last container?", "qid": "1387", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of orange slices that can fit in a container and the number of containers needed to hold all the orange slices.\n\n1. Number of orange slices in a container: 4\n2. Number of containers needed to hold all the orange slices: 329 \u00f7 4 = 82.25\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a container, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of containers.\n\n82.25 \u00f7 4 \u2248 20.5625\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 21 containers.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of orange slices left to fill the last container.\n\n329 - (4 \u00d7 21) = 329 - 84 = 245\n\nThe answer is 245.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1387.png"}
