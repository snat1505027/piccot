{"question": "Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 2. Rebecca has 16 eggs and 3 marbles. How many groups will be created?", "qid": "2084", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of groups of 2 that can be created using the given number of eggs and marbles.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of groups of 2 that can be created using the 16 eggs. We can do this by dividing 16 by 2, which gives us 8.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the number of groups of 2 that can be created using the 3 marbles. We can do this by dividing 3 by 2, which gives us 1.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the total number of groups of 2 that can be created using both the eggs and marbles. We can do this by adding the number of groups of 2 that can be created using the eggs (8) and the marbles (2).\n\n4. The answer is 10.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2084.png"}
