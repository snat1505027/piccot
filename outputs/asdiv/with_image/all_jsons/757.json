{"question": "The school bought 54 basketballs and distribute them into 7 classes equally. How many basketballs are left?", "qid": "757", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many basketballs are left after distributing the 54 basketballs equally into 7 classes.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of basketballs per class. To do this, we divide the total number of basketballs by the number of classes:\n\n54 basketballs \u00f7 7 classes = 7 basketballs per class\n\nNext, we need to find out how many basketballs are left after distributing the 54 basketballs equally into 7 classes. To do this, we multiply the average number of basketballs per class by the number of classes:\n\n7 basketballs per class \u00d7 7 classes = 49 basketballs\n\nSince the total number of basketballs is 54, we can conclude that there are 54 - 49 = 5 basketballs left.\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/757.png"}
