{"question": "The third angle of a triangle is the same size as the first. The second angle is 4 times the third. Find the measure of the angles.", "qid": "1321", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of the angles in the triangle. We know that the third angle is the same size as the first angle, so we can call the first angle x. We also know that the second angle is 4 times the third angle, so we can call the third angle y.\n\nWe can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the angles:\n\nx/y = 4/1\n\nTo solve for y, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 1 to get:\n\nx = 4y\n\nNow we can substitute x with the first angle, which is the same as the third angle:\n\n4y = x\n\nTo solve for y, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\ny = x/4\n\nWe can substitute x with the first angle again:\n\ny = (x/4)\n\nNow we can substitute x with the first angle and solve for x:\n\nx = 4y\nx = 4(x/4)\nx = 4x\n\nSince x cannot be equal to 4x, we can conclude that the given information is incorrect, and there is no solution for the problem.\n\nThe answer is: There is no solution.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1321.png"}
