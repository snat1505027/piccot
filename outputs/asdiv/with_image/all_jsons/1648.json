We know that she had $17 to spend, so the total amount of money is $17.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the amount she spent on rides from the total amount of money. In this case, she spent $6 on rides, so we subtract $6 from $17:\n\n$17 - $6 = $11\n\nThe answer is $11.", "answer": 11, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1648.png"}
