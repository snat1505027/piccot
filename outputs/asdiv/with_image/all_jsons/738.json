{"question": "The capacity of a tank is 32 gallons. If a company bought 728 gallons of oil, how many tanks are needed to hold all the oil?", "qid": "738", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many tanks are needed to hold 728 gallons of oil if each tank has a capacity of 32 gallons.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many gallons of oil can be stored in one tank. We know that the capacity of a tank is 32 gallons, so we can store 32 gallons of oil in one tank.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many tanks are needed to hold 728 gallons of oil. To do this, we can divide the total number of gallons by the number of gallons each tank can hold:\n\n728 gallons \u00f7 32 gallons per tank = 22.75 tanks\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a tank, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of tanks. In this case, we need 23 tanks to hold all the oil.\n\nThe answer is 23 tanks.", "answer": 23, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/738.png"}
