{"question": "The school bought 54 basketballs and distribute them into 7 classes equally. How many basketballs did each class get?", "qid": "756", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of basketballs per class. We know that the school bought 54 basketballs and distributed them equally into 7 classes.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of basketballs per class. To do this, we divide the total number of basketballs by the number of classes:\n\n54 basketballs \u00f7 7 classes = 7 basketballs per class\n\nNow, we can find the number of basketballs per class by multiplying the average number of basketballs per class by the number of classes:\n\n7 basketballs per class \u00d7 7 classes = 49 basketballs\n\nSince the answer is not an exact multiple of 54, we can conclude that the school bought 54 basketballs and distributed them equally into 7 classes, resulting in 49 basketballs per class.\n\nThe answer is 49 basketballs per class.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/756.png"}
