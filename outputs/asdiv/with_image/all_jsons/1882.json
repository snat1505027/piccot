{"question": "Jessica wants of make a garland out of 8 roses, 12 daisies and 48 marigolds. How many arrangements can she make with those flowers so that, there is no flower left.", "qid": "1882", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of flowers and then divide it by the number of arrangements we can make.\n\nThere are 8 roses, 12 daisies, and 48 marigolds, making a total of 8 + 12 + 48 = 68 flowers.\n\nWe need to make arrangements with no flowers left, so we should divide the total number of flowers by the number of arrangements we can make.\n\n68 flowers \u00f7 8 arrangements = 8.5 flowers per arrangement.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a flower, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of flowers per arrangement.\n\n8.5 flowers \u00f7 1 = 8.5 arrangements\n\nSince we can only make whole arrangements, we can make 8 arrangements.\n\nThe answer is 8 arrangements.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1882.png"}
