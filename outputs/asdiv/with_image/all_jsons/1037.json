{"question": "Armand cuts a piece of wire into two smaller pieces that are in a ratio 7:5. The shorter piece is 40 cm. What was the length of the original piece of wire?", "qid": "1037", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the original piece of wire. We can use the given information that the shorter piece is 40 cm and the ratio of the two pieces is 7:5.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the longer piece. We can do this by multiplying the length of the shorter piece by the ratio of 7:5.\n\n40 cm \\* (7/5) = 56 cm\n\nNow, we have the length of the longer piece, which is 56 cm. We can use this information to find the length of the original piece of wire.\n\nSince the shorter piece is 40 cm, we can find the length of the longer piece by adding 40 cm to the length of the shorter piece.\n\n56 cm + 40 cm = 96 cm\n\nThe length of the original piece of wire was 96 cm.\n\nThe answer is 96 cm.", "answer": 96, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1037.png"}
