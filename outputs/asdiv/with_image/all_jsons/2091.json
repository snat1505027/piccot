{"question": "There are 3300 bananas in Janice's banana collection. Janice also has 5 crayons. If the bananas are organized into 75 groups, how big is each group?", "qid": "2091", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the size of each group of bananas. First, we need to find the total number of bananas in the collection. The image shows that there are 3300 bananas in Janice's collection.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of groups. The image shows that there are 75 groups of bananas.\n\nTo find the size of each group, we can divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups. 3300 bananas \u00f7 75 groups = 44.44 bananas per group.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a banana, we need to round the number to the nearest whole number. 44.44 bananas \u00f7 1 = 44 bananas per group.\n\nThe answer is 44 bananas per group.", "answer": 44, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2091.png"}
