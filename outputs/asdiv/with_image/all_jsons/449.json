{"question": "Sunday morning was spent for making wood carvings which can be sold as souvenir for tourists. They were placed in shelves that can contain 8 wood carvings at a time. If 56 wood carvings were displayed, how many shelves were filled with carvings?", "qid": "449", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of shelves filled with carvings. We know that each shelf can hold 8 wood carvings, and we have 56 carvings in total.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of shelves required to hold all the carvings. We can do this by dividing the total number of carvings by the number of carvings per shelf:\n\n56 carvings \u00f7 8 carvings per shelf = 7 shelves\n\nSo, there are 7 shelves filled with carvings.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/449.png"}
