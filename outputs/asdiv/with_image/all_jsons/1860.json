{"question": "Radio station Z-100 was giving away a $100 bill to every 100th caller during a contest and gave Jingle Ball tickets to every 40th caller. How many callers must call before someone wins both a $100 bill and a Jingle Ball ticket?", "qid": "1860", "response": "To find the answer, we need to determine the probability of winning both a $100 bill and a Jingle Ball ticket. We can do this by finding the probability of winning the $100 bill and then the probability of winning the Jingle Ball ticket.\n\n1. Probability of winning a $100 bill:\nThe probability of winning a $100 bill is 1/100, or 0.01.\n\n2. Probability of winning a Jingle Ball ticket:\nThe probability of winning a Jingle Ball ticket is 1/40, or 0.025.\n\n3. Probability of winning both:\nTo find the probability of winning both a $100 bill and a Jingle Ball ticket, we need to multiply the probabilities:\n0.01 \\* 0.025 = 0.00025, or 0.25%.\n\n4. Number of callers needed:\nTo find the number of callers needed, we can use the formula for probability:\nNumber of callers = 1 / Probability of winning both\nNumber of callers = 1 / 0.00025\n\nThe answer is 400 callers.", "answer": 200, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1860.png"}
