We know that Tom has twice as many animal robots as Michael. Let's start by finding the number of animal robots Michael has.\n\nMichael has 8 animal robots.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of animal robots Tom has. Since Tom has twice as many animal robots as Michael, we can multiply the number of animal robots Michael has by 2.\n\nTom has 2 \\* 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 animal robots.\n\nThe answer is 16.", "answer": 16, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/375.png"}
