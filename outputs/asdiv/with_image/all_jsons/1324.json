{"question": "The perimeter of a rectangle is 150 cm. The length is 15 cm greater than the width. Find the dimensions.", "qid": "1324", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of its length and width. In this case, the perimeter is 150 cm. The length is 15 cm greater than the width.\n\nLet's start by finding the width. We can do this by dividing the perimeter by 2, since the perimeter is the sum of the length and width.\n\n150 cm / 2 = 75 cm\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length. The length is 15 cm greater than the width, so we add 15 cm to the width.\n\n75 cm + 15 cm = 90 cm\n\nThe length of the rectangle is 90 cm.\n\nThe answer is: The length of the rectangle is 90 cm, and the width is 75 cm.", "answer": 45, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1324.png"}
