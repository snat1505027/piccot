", "qid": "1661", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers who left. Let's start by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. We know that the waiter had fourteen customers initially.\n2. We also know that after some customers left, the waiter still had three customers.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\nInitial Customers - Customers Left = Remaining Customers\n\n14 - x = 3\n\nNow, we need to solve for x, which represents the number of customers who left. To do this, we can add x to both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 14 - 3\n\nx = 11\n\nSo, the number of customers who left is eleven.\n\nThe answer is 11.", "answer": 11, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1661.png"}
