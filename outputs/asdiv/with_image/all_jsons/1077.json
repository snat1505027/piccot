{"question": "Amanda has two pieces of ribbon, one 8 inches long and the other 16 inches long. To decorate an album, she wants to cut them up to produce many pieces of ribbon that are all of the same length, with no ribbon left over. What is the greatest length, in inches, that she can make them?", "qid": "1077", "response": "To find the greatest length of ribbon that Amanda can make, we need to find the common length that can be achieved by combining the two ribbons.\n\nFirst, we can find the average length of the two ribbons by adding their lengths and dividing by 2:\n(8 + 16) / 2 = 12 inches\n\nNext, we can find the greatest length of ribbon that can be made by cutting the longer ribbon into pieces of the average length:\n12 inches / 8 inches = 1.5 inches\n\nSince Amanda wants to cut the ribbons into pieces of the same length, she can cut the shorter ribbon into pieces of 1.5 inches and the longer ribbon into pieces of 12 / 1.5 = 8 inches.\n\nThe greatest length of ribbon that Amanda can make is 8 inches.\n\nThe answer is 8 inches.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1077.png"}
