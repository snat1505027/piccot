{"question": "Britney brewed lemon tea that's enough to fill ten cups. If she serves this to her parents and three siblings and they share this equally, how many cups will each have?", "qid": "487", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of cups Britney's family will have. Since she has 10 cups of lemon tea and she is serving it to her parents and three siblings, we can find the total number of cups by adding the number of cups for each family member.\n\n10 cups of lemon tea for Britney + 2 cups of lemon tea for her parents + 3 cups of lemon tea for her siblings = 15 cups of lemon tea in total.\n\nSince the total number of cups is 15, and there are 10 cups of lemon tea, we can find the number of cups each family member will have by dividing the total number of cups by the number of family members.\n\n15 cups of lemon tea \u00f7 4 family members = 3.75 cups of lemon tea per person.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a cup, we need to round the number of cups to the nearest whole number.\n\n3.75 cups of lemon tea per person \u00f7 1 cup of lemon tea per person = 3.75 cups of lemon tea per person.\n\nThe answer is 3.75 cups of lemon tea per person.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/487.png"}
