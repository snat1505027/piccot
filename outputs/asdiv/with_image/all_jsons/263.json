{"question": "Some deer families are also moving out to avoid the shortage of grass that will result from occasional blizzards. If there are 79 deer families in the area and around 45 of them stayed, how many deer families moved out?", "qid": "263", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of deer families that moved out. We know that 79 deer families were in the area, and around 45 of them stayed. We can represent this information in a table:\n\n| Deer Families | Stayed | Moved Out |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 79 | 45 | ? |\n\nWe need to find the number of deer families that moved out. To do this, we can subtract the number of deer families that stayed from the total number of deer families:\n\nMoved Out = 79 - 45\n\nThe answer is 34.", "answer": 34, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/263.png"}
