{"question": "I have 28 cents in my pocket. How coins could I have on minimization?", "qid": "159", "response": "To minimize the number of coins, we need to find the smallest possible combination of coins that add up to 28 cents.\n\nFirst, we can find the smallest combination of pennies that add up to 28 cents. Since there are 28 cents, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. 1 penny + 27 cents = 28 cents\n2. 2 pennies + 25 cents = 28 cents\n3. 3 pennies + 25 cents = 28 cents\n4. 4 pennies + 24 cents = 28 cents\n5. 5 pennies + 23 cents = 28 cents\n\nThe smallest combination of pennies that add up to 28 cents is 5 pennies.\n\nNext, we can find the smallest combination of nickels that add up to 28 cents. Since there are 28 cents, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. 1 nickel + 27 cents = 28 cents\n2. 2 nickels + 25 cents = 28 cents\n3. 3 nickels + 25 cents = 28 cents\n4. 4 nickels + 24 cents = 28 cents\n5. 5 nickels + 23 cents = 28 cents\n\nThe smallest combination of nickels that add up to 28 cents is 5 nickels.\n\nTherefore, the smallest combination of coins that add up to 28 cents is 5 pennies and 5 nickels.\n\nThe answer is 5 pennies and 5 nickels.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/159.png"}
