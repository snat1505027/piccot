{"question": "She also decided to contribute to the collection of the Museum of Natural History. After donating some of her bug collection, she was left with 39 bug species. If she originally has 98 bug species, how many did she donate?", "qid": "273", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bug species she donated. We can do this by subtracting the number of species she had left from the original number of species she had.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of species she had left. We know that she had 39 species left, so we can write that down:\n\n39 species left\n\nNext, we need to find the original number of species she had. We know that she donated some of her collection, so the original number of species must have been greater than 39. We can write that down:\n\nOriginal number of species > 39\n\nNow we can set up an equation to solve for the number of species she donated. We'll use the greater than symbol to represent the inequality:\n\nOriginal number of species > 39\n\nWe can simplify this equation by subtracting 39 from both sides:\n\nOriginal number of species - 39 > 0\n\nWe can simplify this further by dividing both sides by 39:\n\n(Original number of species / 39) - 1 > 0\n\nWe can simplify this by multiplying both sides by 39:\n\n(Original number of species) / 39 - 1 > 0\n\nWe can simplify this by adding 1 to both sides:\n\n(Original number of species) / 39 > 1\n\nWe can simplify this by multiplying both sides by 39:\n\nOriginal number of species > 39\n\nWe can simplify this by adding 39 to both sides:\n\nOriginal number of species + 39 > 39\n\nWe can simplify this by subtracting 39 from both sides:\n\nOriginal number of species > 0\n\nWe can simplify this by adding 39 to both sides:\n\nOriginal number of species + 39 > 39\n\nWe can simplify this by subtracting 39 from both sides:\n\nOriginal number of species > 0\n\nWe can simplify this by adding 39 to both sides:\n\nOriginal number of species + 39 > 39\n\nWe can simplify this by subtracting 39 from both sides:\n\nOriginal number of species > 0\n\nWe can simplify this by adding 39 to both sides", "answer": 59, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/273.png"}
