{"question": "A restaurant added a new outdoor section that was 35 square feet. It was 7 feet wide. How long is their new section?", "qid": "1466", "response": "To find the length of the outdoor section, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the width from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 7 feet is equal to 7 x 12 = 84 inches.\n\nNext, we can calculate the area of the outdoor section by multiplying the width (84 inches) by the length (35 square feet).\n\n84 inches x 35 square feet = 2920 square inches\n\nSince the outdoor section is 35 square feet, we can find the length by dividing the area by the width.\n\n2920 square inches \u00f7 84 inches = 35 square feet\n\nSince the length is equal to the area divided by the width, we can conclude that the length of the outdoor section is 35 square feet.\n\nThe answer is 35 square feet.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1466.png"}
