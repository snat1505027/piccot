{"question": "In a basket, there are 24 good oranges and rest are bad oranges. The ratio of good oranges to the bad oranges is 3:1, find the number of bad oranges.", "qid": "798", "response": "To find the number of bad oranges, we need to use the given ratio of 3:1. Let's assume that the number of good oranges is 3x, and the number of bad oranges is x.\n\nFrom the image, we know that the total number of oranges is 24. So, we can write the equation:\n\n3x + x = 24\n\nTo solve this equation, we can add 3x and x together:\n\n4x = 24\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 4 to get the value of x:\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, the number of bad oranges is 6.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/798.png"}
