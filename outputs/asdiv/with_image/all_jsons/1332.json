{"question": "A lab technician cuts a 12 inch piece of tubing into two pieces in such a way that one piece is 2 times longer than the other. How long are the pieces?", "qid": "1332", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each piece of tubing. Let's start by looking at the image.\n\n1. The tubing is 12 inches long.\n2. The tubing is cut into two pieces.\n3. One piece is 2 times longer than the other.\n\nWe can use the information from the image to set up a proportion. Let's call the shorter piece x and the longer piece 2x.\n\nFrom the image, we know that:\n12 = x + 2x\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:\n6 = x\n\nTo find the length of the shorter piece, we can simply multiply 6 by 2:\n12 = 2x\nx = 6\n\nSo, the shorter piece is 6 inches long, and the longer piece is 2 times longer, which means it is 12 inches long.\n\nThe answer is: The shorter piece is 6 inches long, and the longer piece is 12 inches long.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1332.png"}
