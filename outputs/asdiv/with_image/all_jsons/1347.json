{"question": "Mrs. Garvey's bathroom measures 6 feet by 10 feet. She wants to cover the floor with square tiles. The sides of the tiles are 6 inches. How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?", "qid": "1347", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the bathroom and then determine the number of tiles needed to cover it.\n\n1. First, we need to find the area of the bathroom. The bathroom measures 6 feet by 10 feet. To find the area, we multiply the length by the width: 6 feet x 10 feet = 60 square feet.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the area of a single tile. The sides of the tiles are 6 inches, so we can find the area of a single tile by multiplying the length by the width: 6 inches x 6 inches = 36 square inches.\n\n3. To find the number of tiles needed, we divide the area of the bathroom by the area of a single tile: 60 square feet \u00f7 36 square inches = 1.67.\n\n4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a tile, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of tiles. Therefore, we need 2 tiles to cover the bathroom floor.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 240, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1347.png"}
