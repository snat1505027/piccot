{"question": "Hay's Linens sells hand towels in sets of 17 and bath towels in sets of 6. If the store sold the same number of each this morning, what is the smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold? ", "qid": "1816", "response": "To find the smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold, we need to find the total number of towels sold and then divide it by the number of sets of each type of towel.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of towels sold. We can do this by multiplying the number of sets of hand towels by the number of towels in each set and adding it to the number of sets of bath towels multiplied by the number of towels in each set.\n\nThe number of sets of hand towels is 17, and the number of towels in each set is 6. So, the total number of hand towels sold is 17 x 6 = 102.\n\nThe number of sets of bath towels is 6, and the number of towels in each set is 6. So, the total number of bath towels sold is 6 x 6 = 36.\n\nAdding the total number of hand towels sold and the total number of bath towels sold gives us the total number of towels sold: 102 + 36 = 138.\n\nNext, we need to find the smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold. To do this, we divide the total number of towels sold by the number of sets of each type of towel.\n\nThe smallest number of hand towels sold is 138 / 17 = 8.18. Since we cannot have a fraction of a set, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 9.\n\nThe smallest number of bath towels sold is 138 / 6 = 23.17. Since we cannot have a fraction of a set, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 24.\n\nThe answer is 9 hand towels and 24 bath towels.", "answer": 102, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1816.png"}
