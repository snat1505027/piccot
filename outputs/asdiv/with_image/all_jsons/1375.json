{"question": "A square name tag has sides that are 9 centimeters long. What is the name tag's perimeter?", "qid": "1375", "response": "To find the perimeter of the square name tag, we need to use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length of the side, and W is the width of the side. Since the sides are 9 centimeters long, we can find the width by dividing the length by 2: W = L/2 = 9/2 = 4.5 centimeters.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the perimeter formula: P = 2L + 2W = 2(9) + 2(4.5) = 18 + 9 = 27.5 centimeters.\n\nThe answer is 27.5 centimeters.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1375.png"}
