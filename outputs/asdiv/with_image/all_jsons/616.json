{"question": "Harry Hound had a terrible earache yesterday. When I peered into his ears yesterday, I found 36 frisky fleas having a party in his right ear and 85 baby fleas sleeping peacefully in his left ear. I cleaned out Harry Hound's ears. How many fleas perished?", "qid": "616", "response": "The image shows a math problem related to fleas in Harry's ears. It states that there are 36 fleas in Harry's right ear and 85 fleas in his left ear. To find the total number of fleas, we need to add the number of fleas in both ears.\n\n36 fleas in the right ear + 85 fleas in the left ear = 121 fleas in total\n\nThe image also shows that the fleas were cleaned out. To find the number of fleas that perished, we need to subtract the total number of fleas from the initial number of fleas.\n\n121 fleas - 121 fleas = 0 fleas perished\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 121, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/616.png"}
