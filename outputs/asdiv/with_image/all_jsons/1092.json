{"question": "Kiara baked 30 oatmeal cookies and 48 chocolate chip cookies to package in plastic containers for her teacher friends at school. She wants to divide the cookies into identical containers so that each container has the same number of each kind of cookie. If she wants each container to have the greatest number of cookies possible, how many plastic containers does she need?", "qid": "1092", "response": "To find the number of plastic containers needed, we need to find the total number of cookies and the number of cookies per container.\n\n1. Total number of cookies: 30 oatmeal cookies + 48 chocolate chip cookies = 88 cookies.\n2. Number of cookies per container: 88 cookies divided by the number of cookies in each container.\n\nSince we don't know the number of cookies in each container, we cannot calculate the exact number of containers needed. We can only determine the number of containers needed if we know the number of cookies per container.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1092.png"}
