{"question": "Lena had some pocket money. She lost $4 and her mom gave her $9. If she had $66 after that, how many dollars did Lena have at first?", "qid": "662", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial amount of pocket money Lena had and the amount she received from her mom. We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Lena lost $4, so she had $4 less than her initial amount.\n2. Her mom gave her $9, which means she received $9 more than her initial amount.\n\nNow, we can find the initial amount by adding the two amounts:\n$4 - $9 = -$5\n\nSince we cannot have a negative amount of money, we can conclude that the initial amount of pocket money Lena had was $5.\n\nThe answer is $5.", "answer": 61, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/662.png"}
