{"question": "A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many large rooms should be rented?", "qid": "772", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people that can be accommodated in large rooms and small rooms.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of people that can be accommodated in large rooms. We know that each large room can accommodate 3 people. To find the total number of people that can be accommodated in large rooms, we need to multiply the number of large rooms by the number of people per room.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of people that can be accommodated in small rooms. We know that each small room can accommodate 2 people. To find the total number of people that can be accommodated in small rooms, we need to multiply the number of small rooms by the number of people per room.\n\nNow, we can add the total number of people that can be accommodated in large rooms and small rooms to find the total number of people that can be accommodated in both types of rooms.\n\nFinally, we can subtract the total number of people from the total number of people that can be accommodated to find the number of people that cannot be accommodated.\n\nThe answer is 26 - (3*x + 2*y) = <<26-3x-2y>>26 - 3x - 2y.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/772.png"}
