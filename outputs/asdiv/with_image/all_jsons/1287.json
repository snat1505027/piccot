{"question": "The sum of the digits of a two digit number is 8 and the difference between the number and that formed by reversing the digits is 18. Find the number.", "qid": "1287", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the two-digit number that has a sum of digits equal to 8 and a difference between the number and its reversed form of 18.\n\nLet's start by looking at the sum of digits. The sum of the digits in a two-digit number can be calculated by adding the digits together. For example, if the number is 12, the sum of digits would be 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nNow, let's look at the difference between the number and its reversed form. To find the reversed form, we simply reverse the digits in the original number. For example, if the number is 12, the reversed form would be 21.\n\nSo, the difference between the number and its reversed form is 12 - 21 = -9.\n\nSince the problem states that the difference is 18, we can conclude that the original number cannot be the one we found. Therefore, we need to find another two-digit number that meets the conditions.\n\nLet's try the number 29. The sum of digits is 2 + 9 = 11, which is not equal to 8. However, when we reverse the digits, we get 92, and the difference between the original number and its reversed form is 29 - 92 = -63, which is not equal to -18.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not 29.\n\nLet's try another number, like 38. The sum of digits is 3 + 8 = 11, which is not equal to 8. However, when we reverse the digits, we get 83, and the difference between the original number and its reversed form is 38 - 83 = -45, which is not equal to -18.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not 38.\n\nLet's try another number, like 47. The sum of digits is 4 + 7 = 11, which is not equal to 8. However, when we reverse the digits, we get 74, and the difference between the original number and its reversed form is 47 - 74 = -27, which is not equal to -18.\n\nTherefore,", "answer": 53, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1287.png"}
