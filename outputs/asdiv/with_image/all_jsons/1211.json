{"question": "In an isosceles triangle one of the angles of a triangle is 54 degrees. Find the base angles of the triangle.", "qid": "1211", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the isosceles triangle and the angle.\n\n1. In an isosceles triangle, the two angles on the same side of the base are equal.\n2. The given angle is 54 degrees.\n\nWe can start by drawing an isosceles triangle and labeling the equal angles as angle 1 and angle 2. Since the two angles on the same side of the base are equal, we can call them angle 1 and angle 2.\n\nNext, we need to find the base angle of the triangle. The base angle is the angle between the two equal angles. To find the base angle, we can use the following formula:\n\nBase angle = (180 - (angle 1 + angle 2)) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base angle is (180 - (54 + 54)) / 2 = 180 - 108 / 2 = 72 degrees.\n\nNow that we have the base angle, we can find the base length of the triangle. The base length is the length of the side of the triangle that is opposite the base angle. To find the base length, we can use the following formula:\n\nBase length = \u221a(base angle \\* base angle)\n\nBase length = \u221a(72 \\* 72) = 72 degrees.\n\nSince the base angle is 72 degrees, the base length is also 72 degrees.\n\nThe answer is 72 degrees.", "answer": 63, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1211.png"}
