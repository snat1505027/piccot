{"question": "An airplane hangar is 300 feet long. How many planes can fit into it, end to end, if each plane is 40 feet long?", "qid": "637", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of planes that can fit end to end in the hangar. We know that the hangar is 300 feet long, and each plane is 40 feet long.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total length of all the planes that can fit in the hangar. To do this, we multiply the number of planes by their length:\n\nNumber of planes x 40 feet = Total length of planes\n\nNext, we need to find the total length of the hangar, which is 300 feet.\n\nNow, we can find the number of planes that can fit end to end in the hangar by dividing the total length of the planes by the total length of the hangar:\n\nTotal length of planes / Total length of hangar = Number of planes\n\nSo, the number of planes that can fit end to end in the hangar is:\n\n40 feet x Number of planes = 300 feet\n\nNumber of planes = 300 feet / 40 feet\n\nNumber of planes = 7.5\n\nThe answer is 7.5.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/637.png"}
