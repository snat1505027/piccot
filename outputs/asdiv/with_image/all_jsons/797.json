{"question": "The ratio of boys to girls in a kindergarten is 2:3. If the number of boys is 12, find the number of girls.", "qid": "797", "response": "To find the number of girls, we need to use the ratio 2:3, which means that for every 2 boys, there are 3 girls. We know that the number of boys is 12, so we can use this information to find the number of girls.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of girls for 2 boys. To do this, we can divide the number of boys by 2, which gives us 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of girls for 3 boys. To do this, we can divide the number of boys by 3, which gives us 4.\n\nSince the ratio is 2:3, we can find the number of girls by adding the number of girls for 2 boys and 3 boys, which gives us 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nThe answer is 10.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/797.png"}
