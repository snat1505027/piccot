We can do this by subtracting the number of people who dressed up (6) from the total number of people who showed up (13).\n\n6 - 13 = -7\n\nSince the answer is negative, we need to add the absolute value of the number to get the correct answer.\n\n|-7| = 7\n\nTherefore, 7 people didn't wear costumes at John's Halloween party.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1638.png"}
