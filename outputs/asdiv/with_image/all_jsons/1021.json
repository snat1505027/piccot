{"question": "Craig and Brian looked for seashells. For every 9 seashells Craig found, Brian found 7. Craig found 54 seashells. How many fewer seashells did Brian find than Craig?", "qid": "1021", "response": "Craig found 54 seashells, and for every 9 seashells Craig found, Brian found 7. To find the number of seashells Brian found, we need to divide 54 by 9 and multiply by 7.\n\n54 \u00f7 9 = 6\n6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n\nBrian found 42 seashells. Craig found 54 seashells, so Brian found 54 - 42 = 12 fewer seashells than Craig.\n\nThe answer is 12.", "answer": 12, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1021.png"}
