{"question": "Anil is 9 years older than Ajith. In 10 years, Anil will be twice as old as Ajith was 10 years ago. Find their present ages.", "qid": "1307", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. Anil is 9 years older than Ajith, so we can write:\n\nAnil's age = Ajith's age + 9\n\nNext, we need to find the number of years Ajith was 10 years ago. We can do this by subtracting 10 years from Ajith's current age.\n\nAjith's age 10 years ago = Ajith's current age - 10\n\nNow, we can use the information that Anil will be twice as old as Ajith was 10 years ago. We can write:\n\nAnil's age in 10 years = 2 x (Ajith's age 10 years ago)\n\nWe can substitute the expressions we found earlier for Ajith's age and Ajith's age 10 years ago:\n\nAnil's age in 10 years = 2 x (Ajith's current age - 10)\n\nFinally, we can solve for Ajith's current age by substituting the expression for Anil's age in 10 years into the equation Anil's age = Ajith's age + 9:\n\nAjith's current age = Anil's age - 9\n\nWe can substitute this expression for Ajith's current age into the equation for Anil's age in 10 years:\n\nAnil's age in 10 years = 2 x (Ajith's current age - 10)\n\nAnil's age in 10 years = 2 x (Anil's age - 9 - 10)\n\nAnil's age in 10 years = 2 x (Anil's age - 19)\n\nAnil's age in 10 years = Anil's age - 19\n\nWe can simplify this expression by moving the -19 to the right side of the equation:\n\nAnil's age in 10 years = Anil's age - 19\n\nThe answer is Anil's age in 10 years will be Anil's age - 19.", "answer": 48, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1307.png"}
