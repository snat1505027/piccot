{"question": "Two clocks ring once at the same time. After that, the first clock rings after every 90 minutes, and the second after every 60 minutes. After how many minutes will they again ring together?", "qid": "1854", "response": "The first clock rings after every 90 minutes, and the second after every 60 minutes. To find the time when they will ring together again, we need to find the common multiple of 90 and 60.\n\nFirst, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 60, which is 360.\n\nNext, we divide the LCM by each of the original numbers:\n360 / 90 = 4\n360 / 60 = 6\n\nSo, the clocks will ring together again after 4 x 6 = 24 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 24 minutes.", "answer": 180, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1854.png"}
