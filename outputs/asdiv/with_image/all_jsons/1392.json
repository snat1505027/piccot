{"question": "A restaurant needs to buy three hundred eighty-seven new plates. If each box has five plates in it, how many boxes will they need to buy?", "qid": "1392", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes needed to buy three hundred eighty-seven new plates. Since each box contains five plates, we can use the following equation:\n\nNumber of boxes = Number of plates / Number of plates per box\n\nNumber of plates = 387\nNumber of plates per box = 5\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nNumber of boxes = 387 / 5\n\nTo solve this equation, we can either divide 387 by 5 or multiply 5 by 38.7. Let's divide 387 by 5:\n\nNumber of boxes = 387 / 5\nNumber of boxes = 77.4\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of boxes. The answer is 78 boxes.\n\nThe answer is 78.", "answer": 78, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1392.png"}
