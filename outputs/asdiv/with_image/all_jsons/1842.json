{"question": "By coincidence, Luther's Paint Supplies sold equal quantities of two paint colors yesterday: yellow and blue. All yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers while blue paint is sold in containers of 19 liter. What is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold?", "qid": "1842", "response": "To find the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold, we need to find the smallest common multiple of 19 and 2.\n\nFirst, we find the smallest common multiple of 19 and 2:\n\n19 x 2 = 38\n\nNext, we find the smallest multiple of 38 that is a perfect square:\n\n38^2 = 1,444\n\nSince 1,444 is a perfect square, it is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold.\n\nThe answer is 1,444.", "answer": 38, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1842.png"}
