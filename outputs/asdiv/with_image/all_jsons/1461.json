{"question": "Adam was painting a picture frame. The frame was 6 inches wide and 9 inches tall. What is the perimeter of the picture frame?", "qid": "1461", "response": "To find the perimeter of the picture frame, we need to use the formula P = 2W + 2H, where P is the perimeter, W is the width, and H is the height.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the inches to centimeters. 1 inch = 2.54 cm, so 6 inches = 6 \\* 2.54 cm = 15.24 cm and 9 inches = 9 \\* 2.54 cm = 22.86 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\nP = 2W + 2H\nP = 2 \\* 15.24 cm + 2 \\* 22.86 cm\nP = 30.48 cm + 45.72 cm\nP = 76.19 cm\n\nThe answer is 76.19 cm.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1461.png"}
