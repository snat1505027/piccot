{"question": "At Kentucky Fried Chicken, the kitchen staff baked 96 chicken legs, 144 thighs, and 224 wings. The staff had to prepare platters for a catered lunch at an office. Each platter will have the same number of legs, thighs, and wings. How many platters can the staff make if they want the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter?", "qid": "1086", "response": "To find the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter, we need to maximize the number of legs, thighs, and wings on each platter. Since there are 96 chicken legs, we can place 96 legs on each platter. Since there are 144 thighs, we can place 144 thighs on each platter. Since there are 224 wings, we can place 224 wings on each platter.\n\nTo find the total number of chicken pieces on each platter, we need to add the number of legs, thighs, and wings on each platter. The total number of chicken pieces on each platter is 96 legs + 144 thighs + 224 wings = 464 chicken pieces.\n\nSince the staff wants to make the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter, they can make 464 chicken pieces on each platter.\n\nThe answer is 464.", "answer": 16, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1086.png"}
