{"question": "Victor wanted to give each of his six friends an equal amount of candy. At the store he bought three hundred seventy-nine pieces total to give to them. How many more pieces should he have bought so he didn't have any extra?", "qid": "1403", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces of candy per friend. First, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends.\n\n379 pieces \u00f7 6 friends = 63 pieces per friend\n\nSince the number of pieces per friend is 63, we can find the number of extra pieces by subtracting this value from the total number of pieces.\n\n379 pieces - 63 pieces per friend = 316 pieces\n\nThe answer is 316 pieces.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1403.png"}
