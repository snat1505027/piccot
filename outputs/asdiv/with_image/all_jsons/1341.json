{"question": "The area of square photo is 25 square inches. Angie decided to enlarge the photo by doubling the sides. What will the new area be?", "qid": "1341", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the length of the side of the square photo. We know that the area of the square photo is 25 square inches, so we can use the formula for the area of a square:\n\nArea = Side\u00b2\n\n25 = Side\u00b2\n\nSide = \u221a25 = 5\n\nNow that we know the length of the side, we can find the new length of the side after Angie doubles the sides. We can use the formula for doubling a side:\n\nNew Side = Side \u00d7 2\n\nNew Side = 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n\nFinally, we can find the new area of the photo by multiplying the new side by itself:\n\nNew Area = New Side\u00b2\n\nNew Area = 10\u00b2 = 100\n\nThe answer is 100 square inches.", "answer": 100, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1341.png"}
