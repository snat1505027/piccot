{"question": "Terry cut a rope 35 inches long into two pieces in the ratio 3:4. What is the length of the longer piece?", "qid": "1033", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longer piece. We know that the rope is 35 inches long and is cut into two pieces in the ratio 3:4.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the shorter piece. We can do this by dividing the total length of the rope by 4.\n\n35 inches \u00f7 4 = 8.75 inches\n\nNow, we know that the longer piece is 3 times the length of the shorter piece. So, we can multiply the length of the shorter piece by 3 to find the length of the longer piece.\n\n8.75 inches \u00d7 3 = 26.25 inches\n\nThe answer is 26.25 inches.", "answer": 20, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1033.png"}
