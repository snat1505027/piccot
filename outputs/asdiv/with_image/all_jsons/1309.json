{"question": "The second angle of a triangle is double the first. The third angle is 40 less than the first. Find the three angles.", "qid": "1309", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the image as a reference. The image shows a triangle with three angles, and the second angle is double the first angle. We can use this information to find the first angle and then use the third angle to find the other two angles.\n\nLet's start by finding the first angle. Since the second angle is double the first, we can write:\n\nSecond angle = 2 \u00d7 First angle\n\nWe can then use the third angle to find the first angle. The third angle is 40 less than the first angle, so we can write:\n\nThird angle = First angle - 40\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. Second angle = 2 \u00d7 First angle\n2. Third angle = First angle - 40\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously by using the first angle as a common variable. Let's call the first angle x.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can write:\n\nSecond angle = 2x\n\nFrom equation 2, we can write:\n\nThird angle = x - 40\n\nNow we have two equations with one variable:\n\n1. Second angle = 2x\n2. Third angle = x - 40\n\nWe can solve these equations by substituting x for the common variable in both equations.\n\nFirst, substitute x for the common variable in equation 1:\n\nSecond angle = 2x\n\nThen substitute x for the common variable in equation 2:\n\nThird angle = x - 40\n\nNow we have:\n\n1. Second angle = 2x\n2. Third angle = x - 40\n\nWe can simplify equation 1 by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n1. Second angle = x\n\nWe can now substitute x for the common variable in both equations:\n\n1. Second angle = x\n2. Third angle = x - 40\n\nWe can simplify equation 2 by adding 40 to both sides:\n\n1. Third angle = x\n\nNow we have:\n\n1. Second angle = x\n2. Third angle = x\n\nWe can simplify the equations further by removing the variable x:\n\n1. Second angle = x\n2. Third angle = x\n\nThe answer is x and x.", "answer": 88, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1309.png"}
