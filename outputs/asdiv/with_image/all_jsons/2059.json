{"question": "Mary sold 9 boxes of Do-Si-Dos. How many cases of 6 boxes, plus extra boxes does Mary need to deliver?", "qid": "2059", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cases and extra boxes Mary needs to deliver.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of cases of 6 boxes. We can do this by dividing the number of boxes sold (9) by the number of boxes per case (6).\n\n9 boxes \u00f7 6 boxes/case = 1.5 cases\n\nNext, we need to find the number of extra boxes Mary needs to deliver. We can do this by subtracting the total number of cases from the total number of boxes sold.\n\n9 boxes \u00f7 6 boxes/case = 1.5 cases\n1.5 cases - 1 case = 0.5 cases\n\nNow we have the total number of cases and extra boxes Mary needs to deliver: 1.5 cases and 0.5 extra boxes.\n\nThe answer is 1.5 cases and 0.5 extra boxes.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2059.png"}
