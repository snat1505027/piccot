{"question": "Ryan collected 89 leaves. He lost 24 leaves. After a while, 43 more leaves broke. How many leaves are left in his collection?", "qid": "693", "response": "First, we need to find the number of leaves Ryan had after losing 24 leaves. We can do this by subtracting 24 from 89:\n\n89 - 24 = 65\n\nNext, we need to find the number of leaves that broke after losing 24 leaves. We can do this by adding 43 to the number of leaves that broke:\n\n65 + 43 = 108\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of leaves left in Ryan's collection. We can do this by adding the number of leaves he had after losing 24 leaves and the number of leaves that broke:\n\n65 + 108 = 173\n\nThe answer is 173.", "answer": 22, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/693.png"}
