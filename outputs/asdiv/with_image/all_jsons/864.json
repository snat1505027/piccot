{"question": "Kendra learns 12 new spelling words each week. Her goal is to learn 60 new words before her eighth birthday. She has already learned 36 new words. How many more words does Kendra need to learn?", "qid": "864", "response": "To find out how many more words Kendra needs to learn, we need to calculate the difference between the number of words she has already learned (36) and the total number of words she needs to learn (60).\n\n36 - 60 = -24\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Kendra has already learned more words than she needs to reach her goal. Therefore, she does not need to learn any more words.\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 24, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/864.png"}
