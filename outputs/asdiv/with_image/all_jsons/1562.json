{"question": "For Halloween Tom received twenty pieces of candy. If he put them into piles with five in each pile, how many piles could he make?", "qid": "1562", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of piles Tom can make with twenty pieces of candy and five pieces in each pile.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of pieces in twenty pieces of candy. We can do this by dividing twenty by five, which gives us 4.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of piles Tom can make with four pieces. To do this, we can divide the number of pieces (4) by the number of pieces in each pile (5), which gives us 0.8.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a pile, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of piles. Therefore, Tom can make 1 pile with four pieces.\n\nTo find the total number of piles, we add the number of piles we can make with four pieces (1) to the number of piles we can make with five pieces (4), which gives us 5 piles.\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1562.png"}
