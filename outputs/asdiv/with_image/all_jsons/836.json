{"question": "Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?", "qid": "836", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan. Let's start by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Mark had 24 marbles initially.\n2. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan.\n3. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has.\n\nSince Mark has 24 marbles and gives some to Evan, we can represent this as:\n\n24 - x = 3 + x\n\nNow we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\n24 - x + 3 = 3 + x + 3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n24 - x = 6\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can add 6 to both sides of the equation:\n\n24 - x + 6 = 6 + x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx = 24 - 6\n\nx = 18\n\nSo, Mark gave 18 marbles to Evan.\n\nThe answer is 18.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/836.png"}
