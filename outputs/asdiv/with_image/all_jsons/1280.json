{"question": "Five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. Ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. How old are Nancy and Sam?", "qid": "1280", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of Nancy and Sam. We can use the information provided in the image to set up a system of equations.\n\nLet's start by using the information that five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. We can represent this as:\n\nNancy's age 5 years ago = 3 \u00d7 Sam's age 5 years ago\n\nNext, we know that ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. We can represent this as:\n\nNancy's age 10 years later = 2 \u00d7 Sam's age 10 years later\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. Nancy's age 5 years ago = 3 \u00d7 Sam's age 5 years ago\n2. Nancy's age 10 years later = 2 \u00d7 Sam's age 10 years later\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously by using the fact that Nancy's age 5 years ago is equal to Sam's age 5 years ago plus 5 years. We can substitute this into equation 2 to get:\n\nNancy's age 10 years later = 2 \u00d7 (Sam's age 5 years ago + 5 years)\n\nNow we can substitute equation 1 into equation 2 to get:\n\nNancy's age 10 years later = 2 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 Sam's age 5 years ago + 5 years)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nNancy's age 10 years later = 6 \u00d7 Sam's age 5 years ago + 10 years\n\nWe can use this equation to find Nancy's age 10 years later, and then we can find her current age by subtracting 5 years. Similarly, we can find Sam's age 10 years later and then his current age by subtracting 5 years.\n\nLet's start by finding Nancy's age 10 years later:\n\nNancy's age 10 years later = 6 \u00d7 Sam's age 5 years ago + 10 years\n\nWe know that five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. So, we can represent Sam's age 5 years ago as:\n\nSam's age 5 years ago =", "answer": 50, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1280.png"}
