{"question": "Melody printed 53 identical snowman drawings. If she was able to prepare cards with 4 identical snowman drawings each, how many cards was she able to prepare?", "qid": "500", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Melody can prepare using the given information.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many snowman drawings can be placed on each card. Since Melody printed 53 identical snowman drawings, and each card has 4 identical snowman drawings, we can find the number of cards by dividing the number of snowman drawings by the number of snowman drawings per card.\n\n53 snowman drawings \u00f7 4 snowman drawings per card = 13.25 cards\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a card, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of cards.\n\n13.25 cards rounded up to the nearest whole number of cards = 14 cards\n\nThe answer is 14 cards.", "answer": 13, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/500.png"}
