{"question": "Robert wants to practice goal kicks for soccer. He decides to have 98 kicks before going home from the park. He takes 43 kicks before taking a break to get a drink of water. He then takes another 36 kicks. How many more kicks does he need to make before he goes home?", "qid": "116", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of kicks Robert has taken. We can do this by adding the number of kicks he took before taking a break and the number of kicks he took after taking a break.\n\n43 kicks + 36 kicks = 80 kicks\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of kicks Robert needs to take before going home. We can do this by subtracting the total number of kicks he has taken from the total number of kicks he wants to take.\n\n98 kicks - 80 kicks = 18 kicks\n\nThe answer is 18 kicks.", "answer": 19, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/116.png"}
