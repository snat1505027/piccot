{"question": "Zoe bought two coloring books. One had 44 pictures and the other had 44. After one week she had already colored 20 of the pictures. How many pictures does she still have to color? ", "qid": "1790", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pictures that Zoe has to color. We can do this by adding the number of pictures in each coloring book and the number of pictures she has already colored.\n\nFirst, we add the number of pictures in each coloring book: 44 + 44 = 88.\n\nNext, we add the number of pictures she has already colored: 20.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of pictures she has colored from the total number of pictures: 88 - 20 = 68.\n\nThe answer is 68.", "answer": 68, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1790.png"}
