{"question": "Susie and her sister gathered all 98 of their teddy bears and placed them on the shelves in their bedroom. If every shelf can carry a maximum of 7 teddy bears, how many shelves will be filled?", "qid": "476", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of shelves filled with teddy bears. We can do this by dividing the total number of teddy bears (98) by the maximum number of teddy bears per shelf (7).\n\n98 \u00f7 7 = 13.857142857142857\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of shelves filled.\n\n13.857142857142857 \u2248 14\n\nThe answer is 14 shelves filled.", "answer": 14, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/476.png"}
