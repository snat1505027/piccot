{"question": "Jerry was playing the ring toss at the carnival. All together he used forty-eight rings. If each game you get six rings, how many games did he play?", "qid": "1549", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of games Jerry played. We know that he used 48 rings in total and that each game gives him 6 rings. We can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the number of games and the total number of rings.\n\nLet's call the number of games Jerry played \"x\". We can write the proportion as:\n\nx \\* 6 = 48\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"x\". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\nx = 48 / 6\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, Jerry played 8 games.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1549.png"}
