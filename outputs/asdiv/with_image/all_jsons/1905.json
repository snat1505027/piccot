We can do this by multiplying the number of times she played (7) by the number of tickets she earned each time (5).\n\n7 x 5 = 35\n\nNext, we need to add the number of tickets she had before playing the game (6) to the number of tickets she earned (35).\n\n6 + 35 = 41\n\nThe answer is 41.", "answer": 41, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1905.png"}
