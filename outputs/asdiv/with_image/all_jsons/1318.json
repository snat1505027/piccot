{"question": "A number plus itself, plus twice itself, plus 4 times itself, is equal to 104. What is the number?", "qid": "1318", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number that, when added to itself, plus twice itself, plus four times itself, equals 104.\n\nLet's start by writing the equation:\n\nNumber + Number + 2 \u00d7 Number + 4 \u00d7 Number = 104\n\nNext, we can simplify the equation by grouping the terms:\n\n(Number + Number) + 2 \u00d7 Number + 4 \u00d7 Number = 104\n\nNow, we can distribute the addition:\n\nNumber + Number + 2 \u00d7 Number + 4 \u00d7 Number = 104\n2 \u00d7 Number + 4 \u00d7 Number = 104 - Number - Number\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n2 \u00d7 Number + 4 \u00d7 Number = 104 - Number - Number\n6 \u00d7 Number = 104 - 2 \u00d7 Number\n\nNow, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 2 \u00d7 Number from both sides:\n\n6 \u00d7 Number = 104 - 2 \u00d7 Number\nNumber = (104 - 2 \u00d7 Number) \u00f7 6\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 6:\n\nNumber = 104 \u00f7 6 - 2 \u00d7 Number\nNumber = 17 - 2 \u00d7 Number\n\nNow, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 17 from both sides:\n\nNumber = 17 - 2 \u00d7 Number\nNumber = 17 - 2 \u00d7 (17 - 2 \u00d7 Number)\nNumber = 17 - 34 - 2 \u00d7 Number\nNumber = -17 + 34 - 2 \u00d7 Number\nNumber = 17 - 34 - 2 \u00d7 Number\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\nNumber = 17 - 34 - 2 \u00d7 Number\nNumber = -17 + 34 - 2 \u00d7 Number\nNumber = -17 + 34 - 2 \u00d7 (17 - 2 \u00d7 Number)\nNumber = -17 + 34 - 2 \u00d7 17 + 2 \u00d7 Number\nNumber = -17 + 34 - 2 \u00d7 17 + 2 \u00d7 Number\nNumber = -17 + 3", "answer": 13, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1318.png"}
