{"question": "Being a nature lover, she also gave some money to three forest reserves. If she donated $570.00 to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve which is $140.00 more than what she gave to Animal Preservation Park, how much did she donate to all three parks?", "qid": "348", "response": "To find the total amount donated to all three parks, we need to add the donation to Treetown National Park and the donation to Animal Preservation Park.\n\nFirst, we need to find the donation to Animal Preservation Park. We know that the donation to Treetown National Park is $140.00 more than the donation to Animal Preservation Park. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\nDonation to Treetown National Park = Donation to Animal Preservation Park + $140.00\n\nWe are given that the donation to Treetown National Park is $570.00. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n$570.00 = $x + $140.00\n\nSolving for $x, we get:\n\n$x = $570.00 - $140.00\n$x = $430.00\n\nNow that we have found the donation to Animal Preservation Park, we can add it to the donation to Treetown National Park to find the total donation to all three parks:\n\nTotal donation to all three parks = Donation to Treetown National Park + Donation to Animal Preservation Park\nTotal donation to all three parks = $570.00 + $430.00\nTotal donation to all three parks = $1,000.00\n\nThe answer is $1,000.00.", "answer": 1000, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/348.png"}
