{"question": "Virginia had 13 Sweettarts. If Virginia gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 4 friends and then she ate what was left, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?", "qid": "2065", "response": "First, we need to find the number of Sweettarts Virginia had after giving equal numbers to her 4 friends. To do this, we can divide the total number of Sweettarts by the number of friends.\n\n13 Sweettarts \u00f7 4 friends = 3.25 Sweettarts per friend\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a Sweettart, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n3.25 Sweettarts \u00f7 4 friends = 0.8125 Sweettarts per friend\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 1 Sweettart per friend.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many Sweettarts Virginia ate. To do this, we can subtract the number of Sweettarts she gave to her friends from the total number of Sweettarts.\n\n13 Sweettarts - 4 Sweettarts = 9 Sweettarts\n\nVirginia ate 9 Sweettarts.\n\nThe answer is 9 Sweettarts.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2065.png"}
