{"question": "Mrs. Smith gave 53 strawberries to 8 girls equally. How many strawberries were left?", "qid": "741", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many strawberries each girl received and then find out how many strawberries were left.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of strawberries each girl received. To do this, we can divide the total number of strawberries by the number of girls.\n\n53 strawberries \u00f7 8 girls = 6.625 strawberries per girl\n\nSince we cannot divide strawberries into fractions, we need to round the number of strawberries per girl to the nearest whole number.\n\n6.625 strawberries per girl \u2248 7 strawberries per girl\n\nNow, we know that each girl received 7 strawberries. To find out how many strawberries were left, we can subtract the total number of strawberries received by the girls from the total number of strawberries given by Mrs. Smith.\n\n53 strawberries - (8 girls \u00d7 7 strawberries per girl) = 53 strawberries - 56 strawberries = -3 strawberries\n\nSince there are no negative strawberries, we can conclude that there were no strawberries left. The answer is 0 strawberries.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/741.png"}
