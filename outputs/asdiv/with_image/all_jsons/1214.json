{"question": "The base of the parallelogram is 11 inches and its area is 132 Sq. inches. Find the height of the parallelogram.", "qid": "1214", "response": "To find the height of the parallelogram, we need to use the formula for the area of a parallelogram, which is:\n\nArea = base x height / 2\n\nWe know the base is 11 inches and the area is 132 square inches. Let's start by solving for the height:\n\n132 = 11 x height / 2\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply both sides by 2:\n\n264 = 11 x height\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 11:\n\n264 / 11 = height\n\nThe height of the parallelogram is 24 feet.\n\nThe answer is 24 feet.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1214.png"}
