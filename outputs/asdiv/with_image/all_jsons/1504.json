{"question": "Edward had beaten 24 levels in a video game. If the ratio of levels he had beaten to not beaten was 3:1, how many levels does the game have total?", "qid": "1504", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of levels in the game. Let's start by using the given information:\n\n1. Edward has beaten 24 levels.\n2. The ratio of levels he has beaten to not beaten is 3:1.\n\nWe can use the ratio to find the total number of levels in the game. If the ratio is 3:1, it means that for every 3 levels Edward has beaten, he has 1 level left to beat.\n\nTo find the total number of levels, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal Levels = (Number of Beaten Levels) / (1 - Ratio of Beaten Levels)\n\nIn this case, the formula would be:\n\nTotal Levels = 24 / (1 - 3/1)\n\nNow, let's simplify the formula:\n\nTotal Levels = 24 / 0.75\n\nNext, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 4 to make the calculation easier:\n\nTotal Levels = 24 \\* 4 / 75 \\* 4\n\nTotal Levels = 96 / 300\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:\n\nTotal Levels = 24 / 75\n\nTotal Levels = 3/7\n\nTo find the total number of levels, we can multiply the fraction by the total number of levels:\n\nTotal Levels = 3/7 \\* Total Levels\n\nTotal Levels = 3/7 \\* 24\n\nTotal Levels = 24 \\* 3/7\n\nTotal Levels = 9\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 32, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1504.png"}
