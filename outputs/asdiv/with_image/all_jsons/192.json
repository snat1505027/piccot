She got her share of candies which are composed of 10 chewing gums, 15 chocolate bars, and 20 assorted fruit candies. How many candies did she get in total?\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of candies Sam got from the chewing gums. There are 10 chewing gums, so we multiply that by 10 to get the total number of candies: 10 x 10 = 100 candies.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of candies Sam got from the chocolate bars. There are 15 chocolate bars, so we multiply that by 15 to get the total number of candies: 15 x 15 = 225 candies.\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of candies Sam got from the assorted fruit candies. There are 20 assorted fruit candies, so we multiply that by 20 to get the total number of candies: 20 x 20 = 400 candies.\n\nAdding the total number of candies from each category, we get: 100 + 225 + 400 = 725 candies.\n\nThe answer is 725.", "answer": 45, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/192.png"}
