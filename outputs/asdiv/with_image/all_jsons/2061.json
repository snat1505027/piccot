{"question": "If Lillian split 20 Skittles between 8 people in her class and kept the left overs, how many Skittles did each classmate get?", "qid": "2061", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of Skittles each classmate got. We can do this by dividing the total number of Skittles (20) by the number of classmates (8).\n\n20 Skittles \u00f7 8 classmates = 2.5 Skittles per classmate\n\nSince we cannot divide by a fraction, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n2.5 Skittles \u00f7 1 = 2.5 Skittles per classmate\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a Skittle, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n2.5 Skittles \u00f7 1 = 2 Skittles per classmate\n\nThe answer is 2 Skittles per classmate.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2061.png"}
