{"question": "If five is subtracted from three times a certain number, the result is 10. What is the number?", "qid": "1316", "response": "First, we need to find the equation that represents the given information. Let's call the number \"x\".\n\nIf five is subtracted from three times a certain number, the result is 10, we can write the equation as:\n\n3x - 5 = 10\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation. To do this, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\n3x = 15\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 5\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1316.png"}
