{"question": "Last Thursday Drew had $30. Over the weekend he received some money for cutting the grass. He now has $61. How much money did he get paid for cutting the grass?", "qid": "1223", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Drew received for cutting the grass. We know that he now has $61, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\n$30 + Money received = $61\n\nWe can simplify the equation by subtracting $30 from both sides:\n\nMoney received = $61 - $30\n\nMoney received = $31\n\nThe answer is $31.", "answer": 31, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1223.png"}
