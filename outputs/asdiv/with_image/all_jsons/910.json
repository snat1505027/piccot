{"question": "Mrs. Wilson, the math teacher, has 18 logic puzzles and 9 visual puzzles that she wants to group into sets for students who finish their tests early. Mrs. Wilson wants each set to be identical, containing the same combination of logic puzzles and visual puzzles, with no puzzles left over. What is the greatest number of sets she can create?", "qid": "910", "response": "To find the greatest number of sets Mrs. Wilson can create, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 9. The GCD of 18 and 9 is 1.\n\nSince the GCD is 1, Mrs. Wilson can create 18 sets of puzzles, each containing 1 logic puzzle and 1 visual puzzle.\n\nThe answer is 18.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/910.png"}
