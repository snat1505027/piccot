{"question": "Lastly, Rob compared Canada's CN Tower and Seattle's Space Needle. How tall is the Space Needle if the CN Tower stands at 553 m high and it is taller than the Space Needle by 369 m?", "qid": "294", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the Space Needle. We know that the CN Tower is 553 m high and the Space Needle is taller by 369 m.\n\nFirst, we need to find the difference between the two heights:\n553 m (CN Tower) - 369 m (Space Needle) = 184 m\n\nNext, we need to add the height of the Space Needle to the difference to find the final height of the Space Needle:\n184 m (difference) + 369 m (Space Needle) = 553 m\n\nThe answer is 553 m.", "answer": 184, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/294.png"}
