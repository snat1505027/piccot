{"question": "While building the house, Charlie noticed that they were running out of nails so he told his father he's going to buy some. If they still have 9 nails left and Charlie bought 2 boxes of nails, the big one containing 55 nails and the small one containing 31, how many nails will they have?", "qid": "181", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of nails after Charlie bought the two boxes of nails.\n\nFirst, we add the number of nails in the big box (55) to the number of nails in the small box (31).\n\n55 + 31 = 86\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of nails they had before Charlie bought the nails (9) from the total number of nails.\n\n86 - 9 = 77\n\nThe answer is 77.", "answer": 95, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/181.png"}
