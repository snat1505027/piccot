{"question": "After going down the falls, he then went to Rock Mist Mountains. If the mountain is 50 times farther from the city than Sky Falls and Sky Falls is 8 miles from the city, how far is the Rocky Mist from the city?", "qid": "397", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the distance from the city to Rocky Mist Mountains. We know that Sky Falls is 8 miles from the city, and Rocky Mist Mountains are 50 times farther from the city than Sky Falls.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance from the city to Sky Falls. We can do this by dividing the distance from the city to Rocky Mist Mountains by 50.\n\nDistance from city to Sky Falls = Distance from city to Rocky Mist Mountains / 50\n\nDistance from city to Sky Falls = 50 / 50\n\nDistance from city to Sky Falls = 1\n\nNow that we know the distance from the city to Sky Falls is 1 mile, we can find the distance from the city to Rocky Mist Mountains.\n\nDistance from city to Rocky Mist Mountains = Distance from city to Sky Falls + Distance from Sky Falls to Rocky Mist Mountains\n\nDistance from city to Rocky Mist Mountains = 1 + 8\n\nDistance from city to Rocky Mist Mountains = 9\n\nThe answer is 9 miles.", "answer": 400, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/397.png"}
