{"question": "A flash drive could hold nine gigs of data. If you needed to store four hundred sixty-two gigs, how many flash drive would you need?", "qid": "1407", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many flash drives are needed to store 462 gigs of data.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the number of gigs needed (462) into a number of flash drives. We know that a flash drive can hold nine gigs of data.\n\nTo find out how many flash drives are needed, we can divide the number of gigs needed by the number of gigs a flash drive can hold:\n\n462 gigs / 9 gigs per flash drive = 51.33 flash drives\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a flash drive, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of flash drives.\n\nTherefore, we would need 52 flash drives to store 462 gigs of data.\n\nThe answer is 52.", "answer": 52, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1407.png"}
