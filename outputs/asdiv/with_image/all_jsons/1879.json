{"question": "The parents are making sandwiches for the class picnic. They have 72 turkey slices, 48 cheese slices, and 96 tomato slices. What is the greatest number of sandwiches they can make if each sandwich has the same filling?", "qid": "1879", "response": "To make the greatest number of sandwiches, we need to use all the available ingredients. We can use the turkey slices, cheese slices, and tomato slices to make sandwiches.\n\n1. First, we can make sandwiches using the turkey slices and cheese slices. We can use the 72 turkey slices and the 48 cheese slices to make 72/48 = 1.5 sandwiches.\n\n2. Next, we can make sandwiches using the remaining turkey slices and tomato slices. We can use the 72 turkey slices and the 96 tomato slices to make 72/96 = 0.75 sandwiches.\n\n3. Finally, we can make sandwiches using the remaining cheese slices and tomato slices. We can use the 48 cheese slices and the 96 tomato slices to make 48/96 = 0.51 sandwiches.\n\n4. To find the total number of sandwiches, we add the number of sandwiches made in each step: 1.5 + 0.75 + 0.51 = 2.76 sandwiches.\n\nThe answer is 2.76 sandwiches.", "answer": 24, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1879.png"}
