{"question": "The area of a rectangle gets reduced by 9 square units, if its length is reduced by 5 units and breadth is increased by 3 units. If we increase the length by 3 units and the breadth by 2 units, the area increases by 67 square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.", "qid": "1305", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. The area of the rectangle gets reduced by 9 square units if the length is reduced by 5 units and the breadth is increased by 3 units. We can represent this as:\n\n(length - 5) x (breadth + 3) = (length - 5) x (breadth + 3) - 9\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangle when the length is increased by 3 units and the breadth is increased by 2 units. The area increases by 67 square units, so we can represent this as:\n\n(length + 3) x (breadth + 2) = (length + 3) x (breadth + 2) + 67\n\nWe can now solve the equation for the initial dimensions of the rectangle:\n\n(length - 5) x (breadth + 3) - 9 = (length - 5) x (breadth + 3) - 9 + 67\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n(length - 5) x (breadth + 3) = (length + 3) x (breadth + 2) + 67\n\nNow, we can solve for the initial length and breadth:\n\nlength - 5 = length + 3\n\nlength = 8\n\nbreadth + 3 = breadth + 2\n\nbreadth = 5\n\nThe dimensions of the rectangle are length = 8 and breadth = 5.\n\nThe answer is (8, 5).", "answer": 17, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1305.png"}
