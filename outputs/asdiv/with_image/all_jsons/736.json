{"question": "Jack is reading a 285-page book. If he reads 23 pages per day, how many days will he take to finish reading the book?", "qid": "736", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days Jack will take to finish reading the book. We know that he reads 23 pages per day, and the book has 285 pages.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of pages Jack will read by reading the book. To do this, we multiply the number of pages in the book by the number of days he will take to finish reading it:\n\n285 pages (book) \\* 23 pages/day = 6535 pages\n\nNow, we can find the number of days Jack will take to finish reading the book by dividing the total number of pages he will read by the number of pages in the book:\n\n6535 pages / 285 pages (book) = 23.19 days\n\nSince Jack will take 23.19 days to finish reading the book, we can round this number down to 23 days.\n\nThe answer is 23 days.", "answer": 13, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/736.png"}
