{"question": "The present age of Jacob's father is three times that of Jacob. After 5 years, sum of their ages would be 70 years. Find their present ages.", "qid": "1266", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. The present age of Jacob's father is three times that of Jacob. We can represent this as:\n\nJacob's father's age = 3x Jacob's age\n\nAfter 5 years, the sum of their ages would be 70 years. We can represent this as:\n\n(Jacob's age + Jacob's father's age) after 5 years = 70\n\nNow, let's solve the equation:\n\n(3x Jacob's age + Jacob's age) after 5 years = 70\n\n4x Jacob's age + Jacob's age = 70\n\n4x Jacob's age = 65\n\nJacob's age = 65/4\n\nJacob's age = 16.25\n\nNow, we can find Jacob's father's age:\n\nJacob's father's age = 3x Jacob's age\n\nJacob's father's age = 3x16.25\n\nJacob's father's age = 48.75\n\nThe answer is Jacob's age is 16.25, and Jacob's father's age is 48.75.", "answer": 45, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1266.png"}
