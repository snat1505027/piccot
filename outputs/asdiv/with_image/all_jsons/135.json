{"question": "Adolfo made a tower with thirty-five blocks. He added some more blocks and now he has sixty-five blocks. How many did he have to add?", "qid": "135", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of blocks in the tower and the number of blocks Adolfo added.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of blocks in the tower. The image shows that there are 35 blocks in the tower.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of blocks Adolfo added. The image shows that he added 65 blocks to the tower.\n\nTo find the number of blocks Adolfo added, we subtract the number of blocks in the tower from the total number of blocks in the tower after he added the blocks.\n\n65 blocks - 35 blocks = <<65-35=30>>30 blocks\n\nThe answer is 30 blocks.", "answer": 30, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/135.png"}
