{"question": "Rosa is making a game board that is 16 inches by 24 inches. She wants to use square tiles. What is the largest tile she can use?", "qid": "1875", "response": "To find the largest tile Rosa can use, we need to find the side length of the largest tile that can fit within the dimensions of the game board.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the game board:\n\nArea of the game board = length x width\nArea of the game board = 16 inches x 24 inches\nArea of the game board = 384 square inches\n\nNext, we need to find the area of a square tile. To do this, we need to find the square root of the area of the game board:\n\nSquare root of 384 = 18.85\n\nNow, we need to find the side length of the square tile that has an area of 18.85 square inches. To do this, we can use the formula for the area of a square:\n\nArea of a square = side length x side length\n\n18.85 = side length x side length\n\nSolving for side length:\n\nside length = sqrt(18.85)\nside length = 13.7 inches\n\nThe largest tile Rosa can use is a square with a side length of 13.7 inches.\n\nThe answer is 13.7 inches.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1875.png"}
