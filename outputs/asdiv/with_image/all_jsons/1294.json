{"question": "The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?", "qid": "1294", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the charge for a journey of 25 km. We can use the information provided in the image to create a linear equation that relates the distance traveled to the charge paid.\n\nLet's start by looking at the two given points:\n\n1. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75.\n2. For a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110.\n\nWe can use these two points to create a linear equation:\n\nCharge = m \\* Distance + b\n\nwhere m is the slope of the line (the ratio of the change in charge to the change in distance) and b is the y-intercept (the charge when the distance is zero).\n\nTo find the slope m, we can use the following formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere y2 is the charge for 15 km, and y1 is the charge for 10 km.\n\nm = ($110 - $75) / (15 - 10)\nm = $35 / 5\nm = $7\n\nNow we have the slope m, we can find the y-intercept b by using the point (0, $75) from the equation:\n\nb = Charge when Distance = 0\nb = $75\n\nNow we have the slope m and the y-intercept b, we can write the equation:\n\nCharge = m \\* Distance + b\nCharge = $7 \\* Distance + $75\n\nTo find the charge for a journey of 25 km, we can substitute the value of distance:\n\nCharge = $7 \\* 25 + $75\nCharge = $175 + $75\nCharge = $250\n\nThe answer is $250.", "answer": 180, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1294.png"}
