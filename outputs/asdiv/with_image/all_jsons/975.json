{"question": "Ted and Fred measured their height. Their total height is 98 inches. Ted is 39 inches tall. How tall is Fred?", "qid": "975", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how tall Fred is. We can use the information provided in the image to set up an equation.\n\nLet's start by using the information that Ted is 39 inches tall and their total height is 98 inches. We can write an equation:\n\nTed's height + Fred's height = Total height\n\n39 + Fred's height = 98\n\nNow, we need to solve for Fred's height. To do this, we can subtract 39 from both sides of the equation:\n\nFred's height = 98 - 39\n\nFred's height = 59\n\nThe answer is 59.", "answer": 59, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/975.png"}
