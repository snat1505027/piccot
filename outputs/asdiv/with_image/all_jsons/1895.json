{"question": "A music teacher had 2 recorders, but she decided to buy 9 more boxes with each box having 3 recorders in it. How many recorders did she have after buying the 9 boxes?", "qid": "1895", "response": "The image shows a math problem with a question and a diagram. The question is about a music teacher who had 2 recorders and decided to buy 9 more boxes, each containing 3 recorders. The goal is to find out how many recorders the teacher had after buying the 9 boxes.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. First, we know that the teacher had 2 recorders initially. Next, we need to find out how many recorders are in each box. The image shows that each box contains 3 recorders.\n\nNow, we can use the information to calculate the total number of recorders after buying the 9 boxes. To do this, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of recorders in each box:\n\n2 (initial recorders) + 9 (boxes) x 3 (recorders per box) = 2 + 9 x 3 = 2 + 27 = 29\n\nThe answer is 29.", "answer": 29, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1895.png"}
