{"question": "George bought 17 pieces of candy to give to 5 of his friends. If he wants to give each friend the same amount, how many pieces would he have left over?", "qid": "1121", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candy pieces George would have left over. First, we need to find the total number of candy pieces George has. We can do this by multiplying the number of friends by the number of pieces of candy per friend.\n\n17 pieces of candy \\* 5 friends = 85 pieces of candy\n\nNext, we need to find the number of candy pieces George would have left over. To do this, we need to subtract the total number of candy pieces from the total number of candy pieces George has.\n\n85 pieces of candy - 17 pieces of candy = 68 pieces of candy left over\n\nThe answer is 68 pieces of candy left over.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1121.png"}
