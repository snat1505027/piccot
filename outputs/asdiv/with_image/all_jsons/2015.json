Let's start by using the information we have:\n\n1. The waiter had sixty-two customers in his section.\n2. Seventeen of them left, leaving 62 - 17 = <<62-17=45>>45 customers.\n3. The rest of his tables had nine people at each table.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of tables the waiter had. To do this, we can use the following equation:\n\nNumber of tables = Number of customers / Number of people per table\n\nSo, the number of tables would be:\n\nNumber of tables = 45 / 9\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2015.png"}
