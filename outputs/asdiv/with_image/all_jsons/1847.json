{"question": "An English teacher would like to divide 10 boys and 15 girls into groups, each with the same combination of boys and girls and nobody left out. What is the greatest number of groups that can be formed?", "qid": "1847", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 15. The GCD of 10 and 15 is 5.\n\nNow, we can divide the total number of boys and girls by the GCD of 5 to find the number of groups. 10 boys and 15 girls divided by 5 gives us 2 groups of 5 each.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1847.png"}
