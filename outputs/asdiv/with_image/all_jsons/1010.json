{"question": "Thomas made 8700 mL of tomato soup. He packed 1.6 L of the soup in his kids' lunches. He then froze half of the remaining soup. How many milliliters of soup did Thomas freeze?", "qid": "1010", "response": "First, we need to find out how many milliliters of soup Thomas packed in his kids' lunches. We know that he packed 1.6 L of soup, and we need to convert liters to milliliters. \n\n1 L = 1000 mL\nSo, 1.6 L = 1600 mL\n\nNext, we need to find out how many milliliters of soup Thomas didn't pack in his kids' lunches. We can do this by subtracting the amount he packed from the total amount he made.\n\n8700 mL - 1600 mL = 7100 mL\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many milliliters of soup Thomas froze. We can do this by multiplying the amount of soup he didn't pack by 2, since he froze half of the remaining soup.\n\n7100 mL \\* 2 = 14200 mL\n\nThe answer is 14200 mL.", "answer": 3550, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1010.png"}
