{"question": "Andy is buying AA batteries and D batteries. The store sells AA batteries in packs of 38 and D batteries in packs of 44. If Andy wishes to buy the same number of AA and D batteries, what is the smallest number of each battery type that he can buy?", "qid": "1110", "response": "To find the smallest number of each battery type that Andy can buy, we need to find the smallest multiple of 38 and 44 that is a common multiple of both.\n\nFirst, we find the smallest multiple of 38: 38 x 1 = 38\n\nNext, we find the smallest multiple of 44: 44 x 1 = 44\n\nSince both 38 and 44 are prime numbers, they do not have any common factors other than 1. Therefore, the smallest number of each battery type that Andy can buy is 38 AA batteries and 44 D batteries.\n\nThe answer is 38 and 44.", "answer": 836, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1110.png"}
