{"question": "A number added with thrice a number is 20. Convert this statement into algebraic equations and find the number.", "qid": "1188", "response": "Let's start by converting the statement into an algebraic equation. We can write:\n\nx + 3x = 20\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can add x to both sides:\n\n4x = 20\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 4 to get:\n\nx = 5\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1188.png"}
