{"question": "63 people are going to the zoo. There are 3 cars to take people to the zoo. How many will go in each car if the same number go in each car?", "qid": "555", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people that can fit in each car. Since there are 63 people in total and 3 cars, we can divide the total number of people by the number of cars to find the number of people per car.\n\n63 people \u00f7 3 cars = 21.33 people per car\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a person, we need to round the number of people per car to the nearest whole number.\n\n21.33 people \u00f7 1 = 21 people per car\n\nThe answer is 21 people per car.", "answer": 21, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/555.png"}
