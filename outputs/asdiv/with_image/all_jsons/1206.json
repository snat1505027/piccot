{"question": "Mr. White purchased a carpet for rectangular hall of area 800 sq. yards. The length of the hall is 32 yards. Find the required width of the carpet.", "qid": "1206", "response": "To find the width of the carpet, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangle: area = length x width.\n\nGiven:\nLength = 32 yards\nArea = 800 sq. yards\n\nFirst, we need to convert the area from square yards to square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so we multiply the area by 3 to convert it to square feet:\n\n800 sq. yards x 3 = 2400 sq. feet\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the width:\n\n2400 sq. feet = 32 yards x width\n\nTo solve for width, we divide both sides by 32:\n\nwidth = 2400 sq. feet / 32 yards\n\nwidth = 75 feet\n\nThe answer is 75 feet.", "answer": 25, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1206.png"}
