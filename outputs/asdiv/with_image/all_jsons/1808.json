What is the smallest number of grapes that she can pack? ", "qid": "1808", "response": "To find the smallest number of grapes, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of 9. We can start by looking at the smallest multiple of 9, which is 9. Since the smallest multiple of 9 is already a multiple of 3, we can stop looking for smaller multiples of 9.\n\nThe smallest number of grapes that Edeena can pack is 9.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1808.png"}
