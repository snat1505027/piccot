{"question": "Charlie has 31 more snowballs than Lucy. She has 19 snowballs. How many does Charlie have?", "qid": "173", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of snowballs Charlie has and the number of snowballs Lucy has. We know that Charlie has 31 more snowballs than Lucy, so we can set up the equation:\n\nCharlie's snowballs - Lucy's snowballs = 31\n\nWe also know that Lucy has 19 snowballs. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nCharlie's snowballs - 19 = 31\n\nNow, we can solve for Charlie's snowballs:\n\nCharlie's snowballs = 31 + 19\nCharlie's snowballs = 50\n\nThe answer is 50.", "answer": 50, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/173.png"}
