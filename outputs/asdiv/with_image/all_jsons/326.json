{"question": "He also needed some nails. If he already has 247 nails with him and he found another 144 in his toolshed, how many more nails does he need to buy if he needs a total of 500 nails?", "qid": "326", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of nails he already has. We can do this by adding the number of nails he already has (247) and the number of nails he found in his toolshed (144).\n\n247 + 144 = 391\n\nNext, we need to find the difference between the total number of nails he already has and the total number of nails he needs (500).\n\n391 - 500 = -109\n\nSince the answer is negative, we need to add 109 to the total number of nails he already has to get the total number of nails he needs.\n\n391 + 109 = 500\n\nThe answer is 500.", "answer": 109, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/326.png"}
