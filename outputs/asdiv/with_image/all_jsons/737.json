{"question": "Jack is reading a 285-page book. If he reads 23 pages per day, how many pages will he read on the last day?", "qid": "737", "response": "To find the number of pages Jack will read on the last day, we need to calculate the total number of pages he will read throughout the entire book.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of days Jack will take to finish the book. To do this, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:\n\n285 pages / 23 pages per day = 12.4 pages per day\n\nSince Jack will read 23 pages per day, we can round up to the nearest whole number of days to ensure he finishes the book on the last day. Therefore, Jack will read the book in 12 days.\n\nNow, we can find the number of pages Jack will read on the last day by multiplying the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:\n\n285 pages x 23 pages per day = 6385 pages\n\nThe answer is 6385 pages.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/737.png"}
