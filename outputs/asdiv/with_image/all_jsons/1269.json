{"question": "Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?", "qid": "1269", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son, so I was 3x the age of my son. We can represent this as:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 3x Age of the son (S)\n\nNow, ten years later, I shall be twice as old as my son. We can represent this as:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 2x Age of the son (S)\n\nSince we know the relationship between the ages of the person and the son, we can substitute the equation for the age of the son into the equation for the age of the person:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 2x (3x Age of the son (S))\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 6x Age of the son (S)\n\nSince we know that the age of the person is equal to the age of the son plus five years, we can substitute the equation for the age of the son into the equation for the age of the person:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 5 + 6x Age of the son (S)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 11x Age of the son (S)\n\nSince we know that the age of the person is equal to the age of the son plus ten years, we can substitute the equation for the age of the son into the equation for the age of the person:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 11x (S + 10)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 11x S + 110\n\nSince we know that the age of the person is equal to the age of the son plus ten years, we can substitute the equation for the age of the son into the equation for the age of the person:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 11x S + 110\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nAge of the person (P) = 11x S + 110\n\nThe answer is 11x S + 110.", "answer": 50, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1269.png"}
