{"question": "A triangle has a perimeter of 90 cm. The lengths of the three sides are in the ratio 5:12:13. What is the length of the shortest side?", "qid": "1359", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the shortest side of the triangle. We know that the perimeter of the triangle is 90 cm, and the three sides are in the ratio 5:12:13.\n\nFirst, we can find the length of the longest side by multiplying the perimeter by the ratio's largest number (12). 90 cm \\* 12 = 1080 cm.\n\nNext, we can find the length of the second-longest side by dividing the perimeter by the ratio's second-largest number (5). 90 cm \u00f7 5 = 18 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the length of the shortest side by subtracting the length of the second-longest side from the length of the longest side. 1080 cm - 18 cm = 1062 cm.\n\nThe answer is 1062 cm.", "answer": 15, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1359.png"}
