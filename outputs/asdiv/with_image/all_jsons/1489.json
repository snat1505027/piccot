{"question": "The ratio of red cars to blue cars in a parking lot was 5:3. If there were 40 red cars, how many blue cars were there?", "qid": "1489", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of 5:3 and the number of red cars, which is 40. We can set up a proportion to represent the ratio:\n\nRatio of red cars to blue cars: 5:3\n\nLet's call the number of blue cars x.\n\nWe can set up the proportion as:\n\n5x = 3(40)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n5x = 120\n\nx = 120 / 5\n\nx = 24\n\nTherefore, there were 24 blue cars in the parking lot.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 24, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1489.png"}
