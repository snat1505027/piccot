{"question": "There was 1,050 ml of tea in a pot. Anna poured the tea into some cups. If there were 65 ml of tea in each cup, how much tea was left in the pot?", "qid": "779", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cups that can be filled with 1,050 ml of tea. We can do this by dividing the total amount of tea by the amount of tea in each cup.\n\n1,050 ml \u00f7 65 ml = 16 cups\n\nSince there were 16 cups filled with tea, we can find the number of ml of tea left in the pot by subtracting the total amount of tea in the cups from the initial amount of tea in the pot.\n\n1,050 ml - 16 cups \u00d7 65 ml = 1,050 ml - 1,080 ml = 30 ml\n\nTherefore, there were 30 ml of tea left in the pot.\n\nThe answer is 30 ml.", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/779.png"}
