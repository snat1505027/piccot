What is the greatest number of groups Denise can place her stuffed animals into?", "qid": "908", "response": "To find the greatest number of groups Denise can place her stuffed animals into, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 7. The GCD of 14 and 7 is 7.\n\nSince Denise has 14 stuffed cats and 7 stuffed dogs, she can divide them into 7 groups, with each group containing 1 stuffed cat and 1 stuffed dog.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/908.png"}
