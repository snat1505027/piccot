{"question": "Ezra is buying nuts and bolts at a local hardware store. The store sells nuts in packs of 13 and bolts in packs of 8. If Ezra wishes to buy the same number of nuts and bolts, what is the smallest number of nuts that he can buy?", "qid": "1848", "response": "To find the smallest number of nuts that Ezra can buy, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both 13 and 8. We can start by finding the smallest multiple of 8, which is 8. Then, we need to find the smallest multiple of 13 that is greater than 8. The smallest multiple of 13 that is greater than 8 is 13. Therefore, the smallest number of nuts that Ezra can buy is 13.\n\nThe answer is 13.", "answer": 104, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1848.png"}
