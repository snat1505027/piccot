{"question": "Adam had some quarters. He spent nine of them at the arcade and had seventy-nine left over. How many quarters did he have to start with? ", "qid": "1708", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of quarters Adam had. Let's start by using the information we have:\n\n1. Adam had some quarters.\n2. He spent nine of them at the arcade.\n3. He had seventy-nine left over.\n\nWe can use the information that he spent nine quarters and had seventy-nine left over to find the initial number of quarters.\n\nLet's assume that Adam had x quarters initially.\n\nSince he spent nine quarters, he had x - 9 quarters left.\n\nAnd since he had seventy-nine quarters left over, he had x - 9 + 79 = x + 70 quarters.\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nx + 70 = x - 9\n\nx = 61\n\nThe answer is 61.", "answer": 88, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1708.png"}
