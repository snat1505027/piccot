{"question": "Victor was playing checkers with a friend. The ratio of games Victor won was 9:5. If Victor won 36 games, how many games did his friend win?", "qid": "1498", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of games that the friend won. We know that the ratio of games Victor won to his friend's games won is 9:5. We also know that Victor won 36 games. To find the number of games his friend won, we can set up a proportion equation:\n\nVictor's games won : Friend's games won = 9 : 5\n\n36 (Victor's games won) : x (Friend's games won) = 9 : 5\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply:\n\n36 x 5 = 9 x x\n\n180 = 9x\n\nx = 180 / 9\n\nx = 20\n\nThe friend won 20 games.\n\nThe answer is 20.", "answer": 20, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1498.png"}
