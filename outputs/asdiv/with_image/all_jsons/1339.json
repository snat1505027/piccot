{"question": "A square kitchen has an area of 100 square feet. What is the kitchen's perimeter?", "qid": "1339", "response": "To find the perimeter of the kitchen, we need to use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length of the side of the square, and W is the width of the square.\n\nSince the kitchen has an area of 100 square feet, we can find the length and width of the square by dividing the area by the square of the side length.\n\nLength = \u221a(100 / (side length)^2) = \u221a100 = 10\n\nWidth = \u221a(100 / (side length)^2) = \u221a100 = 10\n\nNow we can find the perimeter by adding the length and width together:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W = 2(10) + 2(10) = 20 + 20 = 40\n\nThe answer is 40.", "answer": 40, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1339.png"}
