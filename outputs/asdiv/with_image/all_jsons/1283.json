{"question": "A number consisting of two digits, is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits. When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. Find the number.", "qid": "1283", "response": "Step 1: Let's call the number \"X\".\n\nStep 2: The problem states that X = 7 times the sum of its digits. We can write this as:\n\nX = 7(Y + Z)\n\nStep 3: The problem also states that when 27 is subtracted from X, the digits interchange places. We can write this as:\n\nX - 27 = YZ\n\nStep 4: Now we have two equations:\n\n1. X = 7(Y + Z)\n2. X - 27 = YZ\n\nStep 5: We can substitute equation 1 into equation 2 to get:\n\n7(Y + Z) - 27 = YZ\n\nStep 6: Simplify the equation:\n\n7Y + 7Z - 27 = YZ\n\nStep 7: Move all the terms with Y and Z to the left side of the equation:\n\n7Y + 7Z - YZ = 27\n\nStep 8: Combine like terms:\n\n7Y + 7Z - YZ = 27\n\nStep 9: Subtract YZ from both sides:\n\n7Y + 7Z - YZ = 27\n\n7Y + 7Z - YZ = 27\n\nStep 10: Move all the terms with Y and Z to the right side of the equation:\n\nYZ = 7Y + 7Z - 27\n\nStep 11: Rearrange the equation to solve for Y:\n\nY = (7Y + 7Z - 27) - Z\n\nY = 7Y - 7Z + 27 - Z\n\nStep 12: Rearrange the equation to solve for Z:\n\nZ = (7Y + 7Z - 27) - Y\n\nZ = 7Z - 7Y + 27 - Y\n\nStep 13: We now have two equations:\n\n1. Y = (7Y - 7Z + 27 - Z)\n2. Z = (7Z - 7Y + 27 - Y)\n\nStep 14: We can substitute equation 1 into equation 2 to", "answer": 63, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1283.png"}
