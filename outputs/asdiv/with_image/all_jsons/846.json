{"question": "Megan and her sister, Tara, wanted to buy a scooter for $26. Tara had $4 more than Megan. Together they had enough money to buy the scooter. How much money did Tara have?", "qid": "846", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Tara had. We know that Tara had $4 more than Megan, so we can start by finding Megan's money.\n\nMegan's money = $26 - Tara's money\n\nSince they had enough money to buy the scooter together, we can set up an equation:\n\nMegan's money + Tara's money = Total money\n\nWe can substitute Megan's money with the expression we found earlier:\n\n$26 - Tara's money + Tara's money = Total money\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$26 - Tara's money = Total money - Tara's money\n\nNow, we can solve for Tara's money:\n\nTara's money = $26 - Total money\n\nWe know that they had enough money to buy the scooter, so we can substitute Total money with $26:\n\nTara's money = $26 - $26\n\nTara's money = $0\n\nThe answer is $0.", "answer": 15, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/846.png"}
