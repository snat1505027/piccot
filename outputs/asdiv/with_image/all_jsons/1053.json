{"question": "Warren ran 1 lap on Wednesday, 2 laps on Thursday, 4 laps on Friday, 8 laps on Saturday, and 16 laps on Sunday. If this pattern continues, how many laps will Warren run on Monday?", "qid": "1053", "response": "The image shows a table with the number of laps Warren ran on each day of the week. To determine the number of laps Warren will run on Monday, we need to find the pattern in the table.\n\nWarren ran 1 lap on Wednesday, 2 laps on Thursday, 4 laps on Friday, 8 laps on Saturday, and 16 laps on Sunday.\n\nTo find the pattern, we can look at the differences between the laps on each day:\n\n* Wednesday: 1 lap\n* Thursday: 2 laps\n* Friday: 4 laps\n* Saturday: 8 laps\n* Sunday: 16 laps\n\nThe pattern is that Warren runs 2 laps more on each subsequent day.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of laps on Monday. To do this, we can add the number of laps Warren ran on Sunday to the number of laps he ran on Saturday, and then add the difference between the number of laps on Saturday and Sunday to the result.\n\n16 laps (Sunday) + 8 laps (Saturday) = 24 laps\n24 laps + 8 laps = 32 laps\n\nThe answer is 32 laps.", "answer": 32, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1053.png"}
