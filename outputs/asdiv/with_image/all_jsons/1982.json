{"question": "Chloe and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every six pounds they recycled they earned 1 point. If Chloe recycled twenty-eight pounds and her friends recycled two pounds, how many points did they earn?", "qid": "1982", "response": "To find the number of points earned, we need to calculate the number of points earned by Chloe and her friends combined.\n\nChloe recycled 28 pounds of paper, which is 28/6 = 4.67 points. Since we cannot have a fraction of a point, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of points. Therefore, Chloe earned 5 points.\n\nHer friends recycled 2 pounds of paper, which is 2/6 = 0.33 points. Since we cannot have a fraction of a point, we need to round down to the nearest whole number of points. Therefore, her friends earned 0 points.\n\nCombining the points earned by Chloe and her friends, they earned a total of 5 + 0 = 5 points.\n\nThe answer is 5 points.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1982.png"}
