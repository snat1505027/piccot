{"question": "Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: ducks and seagulls. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 18, the seagulls traveled in flocks of 10. If Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?", "qid": "913", "response": "To find the smallest number of ducks that Heather could have observed, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both 18 and 10. We can start by finding the smallest common multiple of 18 and 10, which is 180.\n\n180 is divisible by 18 and 10, so it is a possible number of ducks and seagulls that Heather could have observed. To find the smallest number of ducks, we can divide 180 by 18, which gives us 10.\n\nThe smallest number of ducks that Heather could have observed is 10.\n\nThe answer is 10.", "answer": 90, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/913.png"}
