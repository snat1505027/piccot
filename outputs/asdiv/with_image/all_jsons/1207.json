{"question": "The area of right angled triangle is 32 sq. cm. If the base is 8 cm, find its height.", "qid": "1207", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the area of a right angled triangle. The formula is:\n\nArea = (base x height) / 2\n\nWe are given that the area of the triangle is 32 square centimeters and the base is 8 centimeters. We need to find the height of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we will substitute the given values into the formula:\n\n32 = (8 x height) / 2\n\nNext, we will multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n64 = 8 x height\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by 8 to isolate the height:\n\n8 = height\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1207.png"}
