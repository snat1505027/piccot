{"question": "Ben and Matt received votes in the ratio 2:3. The total number of votes cast was 60. How many votes did Ben get?", "qid": "1032", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of votes Ben got. We know that Ben and Matt received votes in the ratio 2:3, and the total number of votes cast was 60.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of votes Matt got. We can do this by multiplying the total number of votes by the ratio of Matt's votes to Ben's votes.\n\n60 votes \\* (3/2) = 90 votes\n\nNow we know that Matt got 90 votes. To find Ben's votes, we can subtract Matt's votes from the total number of votes.\n\n60 votes - 90 votes = -30 votes\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of votes, we need to add 60 votes to the total number of votes to get the correct answer.\n\n60 votes + 60 votes = 120 votes\n\nNow we can find Ben's votes by multiplying the total number of votes by the ratio of Ben's votes to Matt's votes.\n\n120 votes \\* (2/3) = 80 votes\n\nThe answer is 80 votes.", "answer": 24, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1032.png"}
