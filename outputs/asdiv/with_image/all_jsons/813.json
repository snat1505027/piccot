{"question": "Jordon put a new number into her machine. The machine doubled it then added 3 more. The number 27 came out of the machine. What number do you think Jordon put in her machine?", "qid": "813", "response": "First, we need to find the number that was doubled by the machine. To do this, we can use the fact that the number 27 is double 27.\n\n27 \u00f7 2 = 13.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction as the answer, we can round 13.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 13.\n\nSo, the number that was doubled by the machine is 13.\n\nNext, we need to find the number that was added to the doubled number. Since the machine added 3 more, we can add 3 to the number 13.\n\n13 + 3 = 16\n\nTherefore, the number that Jordon put into the machine was 13. The answer is 13.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/813.png"}
