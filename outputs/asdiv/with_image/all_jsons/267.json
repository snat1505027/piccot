{"question": "During Halloween, she was able to get a lot of candies from trick or treating. She decided to give away some of them to the homeless kids nearby. If she has 60 candies and gave away 40, how many does she have left?", "qid": "267", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. We know that she had 60 candies initially and gave away 40 of them. We can represent this using the equation:\n\n60 - 40 = X\n\nNow, we need to find the value of X, which represents the number of candies she has left. To do this, we can add 40 to the left side of the equation:\n\n40 + 60 = X\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:\n\n100 = X\n\nTo find the value of X, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100:\n\nX = 1\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 20, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/267.png"}
