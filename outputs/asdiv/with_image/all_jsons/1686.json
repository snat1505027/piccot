{"question": "A group was sitting at a lunch table. After finishing, six people left and there were five left at the table. How many people were at the table to start with? ", "qid": "1686", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of people at the table. Let's call that number x.\n\n1. We know that six people left, so the number of people at the table after they left is x - 6.\n2. We also know that five people were left at the table. So, the number of people at the table to start with is equal to the number of people left at the table after they left.\n\nx - 6 = 5\n\nSolving for x:\nx = 6 + 5\nx = 11\n\nThe answer is 11.", "answer": 11, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1686.png"}
