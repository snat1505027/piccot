{"question": "A vase can hold seven flowers. If a florist had nine hundred five flowers she wanted to put equally into vases, how many flowers would be in the last vase that isn't full?", "qid": "1404", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of flowers that can be placed in the last vase. Let's start by dividing the number of flowers by the number of vases.\n\n905 \u00f7 7 = 129\n\nSince the number of flowers is not divisible by the number of vases, we need to find the remainder.\n\n129 % 7 = 2\n\nThis means that the last vase will have two flowers in it.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1404.png"}
