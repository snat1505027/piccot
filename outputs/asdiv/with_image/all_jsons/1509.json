{"question": "A produce store sold 32 red apples. If the ratio of red apples to green apples sold was 8:3, what is the combined amount of red and green apples sold?", "qid": "1509", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green apples sold. We know that the ratio of red apples to green apples is 8:3, so we can set up a proportion equation:\n\n8 red apples : 3 green apples\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n8/3 : 3/3\n\nThis simplifies to 2:1, which means that for every 2 red apples, there is 1 green apple.\n\nSince we know that 32 red apples were sold, we can find the number of green apples sold by multiplying the number of red apples by 2/3:\n\n32 red apples \\* (2/3) = 21.33 green apples\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of an apple, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number. We can do this by adding 1 to the number and then dividing by 2:\n\n21.33 green apples \u2248 22 green apples\n\nNow that we have the number of green apples sold, we can find the combined amount of red and green apples sold by adding the number of red apples and green apples:\n\n32 red apples + 22 green apples = 54 apples\n\nThe answer is 54 apples.", "answer": 44, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1509.png"}
