{"question": "A rectangular living room measures 12 feet by 10 feet. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border 2 feet wide all around it. What is the area of the border?", "qid": "1351", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the border. The border is 2 feet wide, and it goes around the entire living room. First, we need to find the length of the border. Since the living room is 12 feet long, the border will be 2 feet longer, making it 14 feet long.\n\nNext, we need to find the width of the border. Since the border goes around the entire living room, it will also be 10 feet wide.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the border by multiplying the length and width of the border:\n\nArea of the border = length of the border x width of the border\nArea of the border = 14 feet x 10 feet\nArea of the border = 140 square feet\n\nThe answer is 140 square feet.", "answer": 72, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1351.png"}
