{"question": "A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many short pieces should be cut for?", "qid": "763", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total length of the rope after cutting it into long and short pieces.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of long pieces. Since the worker needs to cut the rope into 4-yard long pieces, we can divide the total length of the rope by 4 to find the number of long pieces.\n\n27 yards \u00f7 4 yards/piece = 6.75 long pieces\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a piece, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of long pieces.\n\n6.75 long pieces \u2248 7 long pieces\n\nNext, we need to find the total length of the short pieces. Since the worker needs to cut the rope into 1-yard short pieces, we can divide the total length of the rope by 1 to find the total number of short pieces.\n\n27 yards \u00f7 1 yard/piece = 27 short pieces\n\nSince we have already cut the rope into 7 long pieces, we can add the total number of short pieces to the total number of long pieces to find the total number of pieces.\n\n7 long pieces + 27 short pieces = 34 pieces\n\nThe answer is 34 pieces.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/763.png"}
