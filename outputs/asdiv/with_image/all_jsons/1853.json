{"question": "In a morning walk, two persons start off together. Their steps measure 75 cm, and 90 cm respectively. What is the minimum distance each should walk so that all can cover the same distance in complete steps?", "qid": "1853", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the common distance that both persons can cover in complete steps. Let's start by finding the total distance covered by both persons in complete steps.\n\nPerson 1: 75 cm\nPerson 2: 90 cm\n\nTotal distance covered by both persons: 75 cm + 90 cm = 165 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum distance each person should walk so that they can cover the same distance in complete steps. To do this, we can divide the total distance by the number of complete steps each person can cover.\n\nPerson 1: 165 cm \u00f7 75 cm = 2.17 complete steps\nPerson 2: 165 cm \u00f7 90 cm = 1.83 complete steps\n\nSince we need both persons to cover the same distance in complete steps, we can round up the number of complete steps for both persons to the nearest whole number.\n\nPerson 1: 2.17 \u2248 2 complete steps\nPerson 2: 1.83 \u2248 2 complete steps\n\nThe minimum distance each person should walk is 2 complete steps.\n\nThe answer is 2 complete steps.", "answer": 450, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1853.png"}
