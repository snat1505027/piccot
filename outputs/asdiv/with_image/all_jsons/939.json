Hannah practices 8 hours every weekend.\n2. She practices 17 more hours than that during the week.\n\nLet's start by finding the total number of hours Hannah practices during the weekend. We can do this by multiplying the number of hours she practices by the number of weekends in a week.\n\n8 hours/weekend \\* 2 weekends/week = 16 hours/week\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of hours Hannah practices during the week. We know that she practices 17 more hours than she practices during the weekend. So, we can add 17 hours to the total number of weekend practice hours.\n\n16 hours/weekend + 17 hours = 33 hours/week\n\nThe answer is 33 hours/week.", "answer": 33, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/939.png"}
