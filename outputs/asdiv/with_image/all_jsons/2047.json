{"question": "Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?", "qid": "2047", "response": "Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many brownies Isabel baked. We know that she baked 3 brownies.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many brownies she still needs to bake. We know that she needed 5 total for her party.\n\nTo find out how many brownies she still needs to bake, we can subtract the number of brownies she already baked from the total number of brownies she needed.\n\n5 total brownies - 3 brownies already baked = 2 brownies still needed\n\nNow, we need to find out how much flour Isabel used on each brownie. We know that she used 5 cups of flour on each brownie.\n\nTo find out how much flour Isabel still needs, we can multiply the number of brownies she still needs by the amount of flour she used on each brownie.\n\n2 brownies still needed \\* 5 cups of flour per brownie = 10 cups of flour still needed\n\nThe answer is 10 cups of flour still needed.", "answer": 10, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2047.png"}
