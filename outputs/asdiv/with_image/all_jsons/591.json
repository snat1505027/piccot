{"question": "In one week, an airplane pilot flew 1,134 miles on Tuesday and 1,475 miles on Thursday. If the pilot flies the same number of miles 3 weeks in a row, how many miles does he fly in all?", "qid": "591", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of miles flown in three weeks. We can do this by finding the total number of miles flown in one week and multiplying it by the number of weeks.\n\nIn one week, the pilot flew 1,134 + 1,475 = 2,609 miles.\n\nTo find the total number of miles flown in three weeks, we multiply the number of miles flown in one week by the number of weeks: 2,609 miles/week \\* 3 weeks = 7,827 miles.\n\nThe answer is 7,827 miles.", "answer": 7827, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/591.png"}
