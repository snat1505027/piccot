{"question": "When relatives visit Haley and her family, she and her cousins do origami. If she has 48 origami papers to give away to her six cousins, how many will each receive if she gives everyone the same number of origami papers?", "qid": "457", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of origami papers each cousin will receive if Haley gives the same number of papers to all six cousins.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of origami papers Haley has. We know that she has 48 origami papers.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of origami papers each cousin will receive. Since there are six cousins, we can divide the total number of origami papers by the number of cousins to find the answer.\n\n48 origami papers \u00f7 6 cousins = 8 origami papers per cousin\n\nTherefore, each cousin will receive 8 origami papers if Haley gives everyone the same number of origami papers.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/457.png"}
