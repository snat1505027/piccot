{"question": "Faye picked eighty-eight flowers for her friend's wedding. She was making bouquets with five flowers in each one. If forty-eight of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?", "qid": "2020", "response": "Faye initially had 88 flowers, and she used 5 flowers per bouquet. So, she could make 88/5 = <<88/5=17.6>>17.6 bouquets.\nHowever, 48 of the flowers wilted, leaving her with 88 - 48 = <<88-48=40>>40 flowers.\nSince she still needs 5 flowers per bouquet, she can make 40/5 = <<40/5=8>>8 bouquets.\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2020.png"}
