{"question": "Tom had thirty-six pieces of clothing to wash. He put eighteen of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into two equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?", "qid": "2016", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces of clothing that can fit into two equal loads. First, we need to find the total number of pieces of clothing that can fit into one load. We know that Tom put eighteen pieces of clothing in one load. To find the total number of pieces that can fit into one load, we can add the number of pieces in the first load to the number of pieces in the second load.\n\nSince there are 36 pieces of clothing in total, and 18 pieces are in one load, we can find the number of pieces in the second load by subtracting the number of pieces in the first load from the total number of pieces:\n\n36 pieces - 18 pieces = 18 pieces\n\nNow that we know the total number of pieces that can fit into one load, we can find the number of pieces that can fit into each of the two equal loads. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of loads:\n\n18 pieces \u00f7 2 loads = 9 pieces per load\n\nThe answer is 9 pieces per load.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2016.png"}
