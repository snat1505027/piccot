{"question": "Melody made 26 cut-outs of Christmas trees with red shiny balls. If she planned to paste 4 of this to the front cover of a certain number of cards, how many cut-outs of Christmas trees will Melody have left?", "qid": "499", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cut-outs of Christmas trees Melody will have left after pasting 4 of them to the front cover of a certain number of cards.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of cut-outs Melody will have left after pasting 4 of them to the front cover of 1 card. We can do this by dividing the number of cut-outs by the number of cut-outs to be pasted on each card.\n\n26 cut-outs \u00f7 4 cut-outs per card = 6.5 cards\n\nSince Melody will have 4 cut-outs left after pasting 4 of them to the front cover of 1 card, she will have 6.5 cards \u00d7 4 cut-outs per card = 26 cut-outs left.\n\nThe answer is 26 cut-outs.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/499.png"}
