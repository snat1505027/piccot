{"question": "While comparing the other robots that they have, Tom and Michael talked about Bob who has a large collection of car robots. If Tom and Michael have 9 car robots and Bob has 9 times more than that, how many car robots does Bob have in total?", "qid": "377", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of car robots Bob has. We know that Bob has 9 times more than Tom and Michael have. So, we can start by finding the number of car robots Tom and Michael have.\n\nTom and Michael have 9 car robots, so we can write that as 9 x 1 = 9.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of car robots Bob has. Since Bob has 9 times more than Tom and Michael, we can multiply the number of car robots they have by 9 to find the number of car robots Bob has.\n\n9 x 9 = 81\n\nThe answer is 81.", "answer": 81, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/377.png"}
