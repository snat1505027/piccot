What is the greatest number of refreshment tables that Lindsey can stock?", "qid": "1070", "response": "To find the greatest number of refreshment tables, we need to find the total number of cans of soda that can be used to create these tables.\n\n1. We have 16 cans of regular soda.\n2. We have 8 cans of diet soda.\n\nTo find the total number of cans of soda, we need to add the number of cans of regular soda and diet soda.\n\n16 (regular soda) + 8 (diet soda) = 24 cans of soda\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest number of refreshment tables that can be created using these 24 cans of soda.\n\nTo do this, we need to divide the total number of cans of soda by the number of cans required for each refreshment table.\n\n24 (cans of soda) \u00f7 8 (cans per table) = 3 refreshment tables\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1070.png"}
