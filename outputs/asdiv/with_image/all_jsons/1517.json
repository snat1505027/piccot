{"question": "A cafeteria sold 49 cartons of regular flavored milk. If the ratio of regular milk sold to chocolate milk sold was 7:2, what is the combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold?", "qid": "1517", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold. We know that the ratio of regular milk sold to chocolate milk sold is 7:2. Let's call the combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold \"x\".\n\nWe can set up a proportion to represent the ratio:\n\n7x / 2x = 49\n\nNow, we can simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying:\n\n7x \\* 2 = 49 \\* 2x\n\n7x = 98\n\nx = 14\n\nSo, the combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold is 14 cartons.\n\nThe answer is 14.", "answer": 63, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1517.png"}
