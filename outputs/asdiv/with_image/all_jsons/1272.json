{"question": "Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. After 5 years his age will be twice the sum of age of two children. Find the age of father.", "qid": "1272", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children.\n2. After 5 years, his age will be twice the sum of the ages of his two children.\n\nLet's denote the ages of the children as x and y.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can write:\n\nFather's age = 3(x + y)\n\nFrom the second statement, we can write:\n\nFather's age after 5 years = 2(x + y)\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. 3(x + y) = Father's age\n2. 2(x + y) = Father's age after 5 years\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously by using the elimination method. First, we can eliminate x by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\n2(x + y) - 3(x + y) = Father's age after 5 years - Father's age\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\ny = 2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of y back into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\n3(x + 2) = Father's age\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 1\n\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can find the age of the father. From the first equation, we know that the father's age is three times the sum of the children's ages. So, the father's age is:\n\nFather's age = 3(x + y) = 3(1 + 2) = 3(3) = 9\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 15, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1272.png"}
