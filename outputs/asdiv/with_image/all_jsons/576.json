Connie had x marbles to start with.\n2. She gave 183 marbles to Juan, leaving her with x - 183 marbles.\n3. She now has 593 marbles left, so we can set up an equation:\nx - 183 = 593\n\n1. Solve the equation for x:\nx = 593 + 183\nx = 776\n\nThe answer is 776.", "answer": 776, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/576.png"}
