{"question": "For a potluck lunch Debby brought 10 bottles of soda. If everyone only drank 8 of the sodas, how many did she have to take back home?", "qid": "1585", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sodas were consumed by everyone. Since there are 10 bottles of soda and 8 sodas were consumed, we can find the difference between the two.\n\n10 bottles of soda - 8 sodas consumed = <<10-8=2>>2 sodas left over\n\nSince Debby brought 10 bottles of soda and 2 sodas were left over, she has to take back home 2 sodas.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1585.png"}
