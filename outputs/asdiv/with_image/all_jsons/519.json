{"question": "This year on your 11th birthday your mother tells you that she is exactly 3 times as old as you are. How old is she?", "qid": "519", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the age of the mother. We know that the mother is 3 times as old as the child, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nMother's age = 3 x Child's age\n\nWe also know that the child is 11 years old, so we can substitute the child's age into the equation:\n\nMother's age = 3 x 11\n\nMother's age = 33\n\nThe answer is 33.", "answer": 33, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/519.png"}
