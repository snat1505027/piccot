{"question": "A clown needed two hundred twenty-seven balloons for a party he was going to, but the balloons only came in packs of two. How many packs of balloons would he need to buy?", "qid": "1398", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of packs of balloons the clown would need to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of balloons by the number of balloons in each pack.\n\n227 balloons \u00f7 2 balloons per pack = 113.5 packs of balloons\n\nSince we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of packs.\n\n113.5 packs of balloons rounded up to the nearest whole number = 114 packs of balloons\n\nThe answer is 114 packs of balloons.", "answer": 114, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1398.png"}
