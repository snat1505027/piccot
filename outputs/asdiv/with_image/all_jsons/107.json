{"question": "Alex had some candles for his Jack O'Lanterns. He used 32 of them. Now he has 12 left. How many candles did Alex have to start with?", "qid": "107", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles Alex had to start with. Let's call that number \"x\".\n\nWe know that Alex used 32 candles, so the number of candles left is 12.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the information:\nx - 32 = 12\n\nNow we need to solve the equation to find the value of \"x\". To do this, we can add 32 to both sides of the equation:\nx = 12 + 32\n\nNow we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\nx = 44\n\nSo, Alex had 44 candles to start with.\n\nThe answer is 44.", "answer": 44, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/107.png"}
