{"question": "If one pack of gum costs $2, how many packs of gum can you buy with $16?", "qid": "1218", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of packs of gum that can be bought with $16.\n\nFirst, we need to find the cost of one pack of gum. We know that one pack of gum costs $2.\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of the number of packs of gum we can buy with $16. We can do this by multiplying the cost of one pack of gum by the number of packs we can buy.\n\nTo find the number of packs of gum we can buy, we need to divide $16 by the cost of one pack of gum.\n\n$16 / $2 = <<16/2=8>>8\n\nSo, we can buy 8 packs of gum with $16.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1218.png"}
