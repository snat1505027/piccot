{"question": "Chloe agreed to wash all of the windows in Todd's giant art studio. There are 400 square panes of glass each measuring 2.5 feet on each side. Todd offered to pay 10 cents per square foot. Chloe said she would rather get paid 60 cents a pane. Todd agreed and was happy that he was actually going to save money. How much money will Todd save?", "qid": "1354", "response": "First, we need to calculate the total number of square feet in the windows. There are 400 square panes, and each pane measures 2.5 feet on each side. So, the total number of square feet is:\n\n400 panes \\* 2.5 feet per pane \\* 2.5 feet per pane = 2,000 square feet\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost per square foot that Todd will pay Chloe. Chloe wants to be paid 60 cents per pane, but Todd will pay her 10 cents per square foot. So, the cost per square foot is:\n\n60 cents per pane \\* 2.5 feet per pane = $1.50 per square foot\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount Todd will save by paying Chloe 60 cents per pane instead of 10 cents per square foot:\n\nAmount saved = Cost per square foot - Cost per pane\nAmount saved = $1.50 per square foot - $0.60 per pane\nAmount saved = $0.90 per square foot\n\nSince there are 2,000 square feet in the windows, Todd will save:\n\nAmount saved \\* Total square feet = $0.90 per square foot \\* 2,000 square feet\n\nThe answer is $1,800.", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1354.png"}
