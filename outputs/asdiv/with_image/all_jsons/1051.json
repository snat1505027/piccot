{"question": "Malia is picking berries in the berry patch. She picks 3 berries from the first bush, 4 berries from the second bush, 7 berries from the third bush, and 12 berries from the fourth bush. If this pattern continues, how many berries will Malia pick from the fifth bush?", "qid": "1051", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the pattern in which the number of berries picked increases. The image shows that the number of berries picked increases by 3, 4, 7, and 12 from each bush. To find the pattern, we can look at the differences between the numbers of berries picked from each bush:\n\n1. 3 berries from the first bush - 0 berries from the second bush = 3 berries\n2. 4 berries from the second bush - 3 berries from the third bush = 1 berry\n3. 7 berries from the third bush - 4 berries from the fourth bush = 3 berries\n4. 12 berries from the fourth bush - 7 berries from the fifth bush = 5 berries\n\nThe pattern is that the number of berries picked increases by 3, 1, 3, and 5 from each bush. To find the number of berries picked from the fifth bush, we can add 5 berries to the number of berries picked from the fourth bush:\n\n12 berries from the fourth bush + 5 berries = 17 berries from the fifth bush\n\nThe answer is 17 berries.", "answer": 19, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1051.png"}
