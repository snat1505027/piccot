{"question": "George had 648 pieces of candy. If he split the candy into 8 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many pieces would each bag have in it?", "qid": "1421", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces of candy in each bag. First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy in 8 bags. We can do this by multiplying the number of pieces of candy by the number of bags.\n\n648 pieces of candy \\* 8 bags = <<648*8=5344>>5344 pieces of candy in 8 bags\n\nNow, we need to divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of bags to find the number of pieces of candy in each bag.\n\n5344 pieces of candy / 8 bags = <<5344/8=668>>668 pieces of candy in each bag\n\nThe answer is 668.", "answer": 81, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1421.png"}
