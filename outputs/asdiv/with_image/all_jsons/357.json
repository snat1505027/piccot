We know that each pitcher can fill 6 glasses, and they plan to make 9 pitchers.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of glasses that can be filled by the 9 pitchers. We can do this by multiplying the number of glasses per pitcher by the number of pitchers:\n\n6 glasses per pitcher \\* 9 pitchers = 54 glasses\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of glasses of drinks. We can do this by multiplying the total number of glasses by the number of drinks per glass:\n\n54 glasses \\* 1 drink per glass = 54 drinks\n\nThe answer is 54 drinks.", "answer": 54, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/357.png"}
