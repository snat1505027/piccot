{"question": "Kathleen is a dental sales representative who wants to distribute 18 brochures and 12 pamphlets to local dental offices. She wants to deliver the same combination of brochures and pamphlets to each office, without having any materials left over. What is the greatest number of dental offices Kathleen can distribute materials to?", "qid": "905", "response": "To find the greatest number of dental offices Kathleen can distribute materials to, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 12.\n\n18 \u00f7 3 = 6 (with a remainder of 2)\n12 \u00f7 2 = 6 (with a remainder of 0)\n\nSince both 6 and 0 are divisible by 6, the GCD of 18 and 12 is 6.\n\nTo find the greatest number of dental offices, we need to multiply the GCD (6) by the total number of materials (18 brochures + 12 pamphlets = 20).\n\n6 x 20 = 120\n\nThe answer is 120.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/905.png"}
