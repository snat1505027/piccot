{"question": "Edward spent $2 on a board game and then he bought 4 action figures for $7 each. How much money did he spend on the game and figures?", "qid": "1902", "response": "First, we need to find the cost of the board game. We know that Edward spent $2 on the board game. To find the cost of the board game, we can set up the equation:\n\n2 (cost of board game) = x (total cost of board game and action figures)\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of the board game and action figures. We know that Edward spent $2 on the board game and $7 on each action figure. To find the total cost, we can set up the equation:\n\nx = 2 (cost of board game) + 4 (cost of action figures)\n\nNow, we can substitute the equation we found earlier into the equation for the total cost:\n\nx = 2 (cost of board game) + 4 (cost of action figures)\n\nx = 2 + 4\n\nx = 6\n\nThe total cost of the board game and action figures is $6. The answer is $6.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1902.png"}
