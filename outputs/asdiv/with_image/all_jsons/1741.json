{"question": "Adam picked thirty-five strawberries. After eating some, he had thirty-three left. How many strawberries did Adam eat?", "qid": "1741", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many strawberries Adam ate. We know that he picked thirty-five strawberries and had thirty-three left. We can set up the equation:\n\nStrawberries picked - Strawberries eaten = Strawberries left\n\n35 - X = 33\n\nNow, we need to solve for X, which represents the number of strawberries Adam ate. To do this, we can add 35 to both sides of the equation:\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 + X = 33\n\n35 +", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1741.png"}
