{"question": "You have $12 in nickels and quarters. If you have the same number of each kind of coin, how many nickels do you have?", "qid": "1002", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of nickels and quarters in the given amount of $12.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of quarters in $12. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we can find the number of quarters by dividing the amount by the number of quarters in a dollar.\n\n$12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\n2. Now, we know that there are 3 quarters in $12. To find the number of nickels, we need to subtract the number of quarters from the total amount.\n\n$12 - 3 = $9\n\n3. Since there are 20 nickels in a dollar, we can find the number of nickels by dividing the remaining amount by the number of nickels in a dollar.\n\n$9 \u00f7 20 = 0.45\n\n4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a coin, we need to round the number of nickels to the nearest whole number.\n\n0.45 \u2248 1\n\n5. Now we have the number of quarters and nickels. We can conclude that there are 3 quarters and 1 nickel in $12.\n\nThe answer is 3 quarters and 1 nickel.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1002.png"}
