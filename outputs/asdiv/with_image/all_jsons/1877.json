{"question": "Three pieces of timber 42 m, 49 m and 63 m long have to be divided into planks of the same length. What is the greatest possible length of each plank?", "qid": "1877", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest possible length of each plank. We can start by finding the sum of the three pieces of timber: 42 m + 49 m + 63 m = 154 m.\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the planks. We can do this by dividing the total length of the timber by the number of planks. Let's assume we can make 10 planks. So, the length of each plank would be: 154 m / 10 = 15.4 m.\n\nHowever, we need to round the length of each plank to the nearest whole number. The smallest whole number that is greater than 15.4 m is 16 m. Therefore, the greatest possible length of each plank is 16 m.\n\nThe answer is 16 m.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1877.png"}
