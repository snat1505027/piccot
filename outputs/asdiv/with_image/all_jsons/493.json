{"question": "Lex read a 420 page book about music and instruments. If he can read exactly 30 pages a day, how many days will it take Lex to finish reading the book?", "qid": "493", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take Lex to finish reading the book. We know that Lex can read 30 pages a day, and the book has 420 pages.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many pages Lex can read in a day. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages (420) by the number of pages Lex can read in a day (30).\n\n420 pages / 30 pages per day = 14 days\n\nSince Lex can read 30 pages a day, it will take him 14 days to finish reading the book.\n\nThe answer is 14 days.", "answer": 14, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/493.png"}
