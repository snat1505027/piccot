{"question": "Ronnie travels 300 km to her home partly by train and partly by bus. She takes 4 hours if she travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus. If she travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, she takes 10 minutes longer. Find the speed of the train and bus separately.", "qid": "1298", "response": "First, we need to find the distance traveled by train and bus separately. Let's call the distance traveled by train 'x' km and the distance traveled by bus 'y' km.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that Ronnie travels 300 km in total, and she takes 4 hours if she travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus. So, we can write the following equation:\n\nx + y = 300\n\nWe also know that if she travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus, she takes 10 minutes longer. So, we can write the following equation:\n\nx + y = 100 + 10\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can find x:\n\nx = 300 - y\n\nAnd from the second equation, we can find y:\n\ny = 100 + 10 - x\n\nSubstituting the value of x from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\ny = 100 + 10 - (300 - y)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\ny = 100 - 290 + 10\n\ny = 10\n\nSubstituting the value of y into the first equation, we can find x:\n\nx = 300 - 10\n\nx = 290\n\nSo, the distance traveled by train is 290 km, and the distance traveled by bus is 10 km.\n\nNext, we need to find the speed of the train and bus separately. Let's call the speed of the train 'a' km/h and the speed of the bus 'b' km/h.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can find the time taken by the train:\n\nt = (x / a) + (y / b)\n\nSubstituting the values of x and y, we get:\n\nt = (290 / a) + (10 / b)\n\nt = 290 / a + 10 / b\n\nWe know that", "answer": 60, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1298.png"}
