{"question": "Joe, Susie's brother, collected all 94 trading cards scattered in his room and placed them in boxes. If a full box can hold a maximum of 8 cards, how many cards are there in the unfilled box?", "qid": "479", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cards in the unfilled box. We know that a full box can hold a maximum of 8 cards, and there are 94 cards in total. Let's start by finding the number of full boxes that can be filled with 8 cards each.\n\n94 cards / 8 cards per box = 11.75 boxes\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of boxes.\n\n11.75 boxes rounded up = 12 boxes\n\nNow, we can find the number of cards in the unfilled box.\n\n94 cards - (12 boxes x 8 cards per box) = 94 cards - 96 cards\n\nThe answer is 94 cards - 96 cards = -2 cards.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/479.png"}
