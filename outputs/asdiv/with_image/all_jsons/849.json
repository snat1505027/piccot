{"question": "My ice cream shop was really busy today. It was 98 degrees and we sold 67 ice cream cones. We sold 15 more milkshakes than ice cream cones. How many milkshakes were sold?", "qid": "849", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of milkshakes sold. We know that 15 more milkshakes were sold than ice cream cones. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nMilkshakes sold = Ice cream cones sold + 15\n\nWe are given that 67 ice cream cones were sold. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nMilkshakes sold = 67 + 15\n\nMilkshakes sold = 82\n\nThe answer is 82.", "answer": 82, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/849.png"}
