{"question": "Chef Pillsbury's secret recipe requires 7 eggs for every 2 cups of flour. How many eggs will he need if he uses 8 cups of flour?", "qid": "1028", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of eggs needed when using 8 cups of flour.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of eggs per 2 cups of flour. We know that 7 eggs are needed for every 2 cups of flour. So, we can find the number of eggs per cup of flour by dividing 7 by 2:\n\n7 eggs / 2 cups of flour = 3.5 eggs per cup of flour\n\nNext, we need to find the number of cups of flour in 8 cups of flour. We can do this by dividing 8 by the number of cups per 8 cups of flour:\n\n8 cups of flour / 8 cups per 8 cups of flour = 1 cup of flour\n\nNow, we can find the number of eggs needed by multiplying the number of cups of flour by the number of eggs per cup of flour:\n\n1 cup of flour x 3.5 eggs per cup of flour = 3.5 eggs\n\nThe answer is 3.5 eggs.", "answer": 28, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1028.png"}
