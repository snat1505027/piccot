We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. The dog ate 12 notecards, which is 3/4 of the total number of notecards needed.\n2. We can find the number of notecards needed by dividing the number of notecards eaten by 3/4.\n\n12 notecards eaten \u00f7 3/4 = 12 notecards needed\n\n1. Since the person had 12 notecards eaten, we can find the number of notecards they had completed by subtracting the number of notecards eaten from the total number of notecards needed.\n\n12 notecards needed - 12 notecards eaten = 0 notecards completed\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 16, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1220.png"}
