{"question": "They had 119 matchboxes wrapped in colorful shiny wrappers. If they are to distribute the matchboxes equally to the 9 houses in the first block, how many colorful matchboxes will they have left?", "qid": "483", "response": "To distribute the matchboxes equally to the 9 houses in the first block, they will need to divide the total number of matchboxes by the number of houses.\n\n119 matchboxes \u00f7 9 houses = 13.1111...\n\nSince they cannot distribute a fraction of a matchbox, they will need to round the number of matchboxes to be distributed to the nearest whole number.\n\n13 matchboxes will be distributed to each house.\n\nTo find out how many colorful matchboxes will be left, we need to subtract the total number of matchboxes distributed from the total number of matchboxes.\n\n119 matchboxes - (9 houses \u00d7 13 matchboxes per house) = 119 - 126 = -7 matchboxes\n\nSince there cannot be a negative number of matchboxes left, we can conclude that there are no colorful matchboxes left.\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/483.png"}
