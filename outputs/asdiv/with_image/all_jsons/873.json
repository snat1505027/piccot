We can do this by adding the number of years she has taught third grade and the number of years she has taught second grade.\n\nFirst, we add 18 and 8 to find the total number of years she has taught third and second grade, respectively.\n\n18 + 8 = 26\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of years she has been teaching. We can do this by multiplying the total number of years she has taught third and second grade by the number of students she has this year.\n\n26 x 26 = 676\n\nThe answer is 676.", "answer": 26, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/873.png"}
