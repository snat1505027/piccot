{"question": "Matt has two pieces of cord, one 15 feet long and the other 12 feet long. He wants to cut them up to produce many pieces of cord that are all of the same length, with no cord left over. What is the greatest length, in feet, that he can make them?", "qid": "907", "response": "To find the greatest length of cord that Matt can make, we need to find the length of the cord that can be cut from each piece without leaving any cord over.\n\nLet's start by cutting the 15-foot cord into pieces of 12 feet each. We can do this by cutting it in half, then cutting each half in half again. This will give us 4 pieces of 12 feet each.\n\nNow, let's cut the 12-foot cord into pieces of 15 feet each. We can do this by cutting it in half, then cutting each half in half again. This will give us 4 pieces of 15 feet each.\n\nSince we have 4 pieces of 12 feet and 4 pieces of 15 feet, we can combine them to make a total of 8 pieces of cord, each with a length of 12 + 15 = 27 feet.\n\nThe answer is 27 feet.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/907.png"}
