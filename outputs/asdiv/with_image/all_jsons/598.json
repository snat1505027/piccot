{"question": "A regular octagon whose sides measure 3 ft each. Find the perimeter. ", "qid": "598", "response": "To find the perimeter of a regular octagon, we need to use the formula P = 8s, where P is the perimeter, and s is the length of each side. In this case, the sides of the regular octagon measure 3 ft each.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of each side. Since the sides are equal, we can simply divide the perimeter by 8 to find the length of each side:\n\nP = 8s\n3ft = 8s\ns = 3ft / 8\ns = 0.375 ft\n\nNow that we have the length of each side, we can calculate the perimeter:\n\nP = 8s\nP = 8 x 0.375 ft\nP = 3.00 ft\n\nThe answer is 3.00 ft.", "answer": 24, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/598.png"}
