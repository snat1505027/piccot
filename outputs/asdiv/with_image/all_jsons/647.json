{"question": "Mrs. Hilt has 6 pizzas. Each pizza has 6 slices. She sold one-fourth of the pizza slices. How many slices were left?", "qid": "647", "response": "Mrs. Hilt has 6 pizzas, and each pizza has 6 slices. To find the total number of slices, we need to multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 6 pizzas x 6 slices per pizza = 36 slices.\n\nShe sold one-fourth of the pizza slices, which means she sold 36 slices / 4 = 9 slices.\n\nTo find the number of slices left, we need to subtract the number of slices sold from the total number of slices: 36 slices - 9 slices = 27 slices.\n\nThe answer is 27 slices.", "answer": 27, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/647.png"}
