{"question": "A group of science students went on a field trip. They took 2 vans and 3 buses. There were 8 people in each van and 20 people in each bus. How many people went on the field trip?", "qid": "635", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of people in the vans and buses.\n\nIn the vans, there are 2 vans, and each van has 8 people. So, the total number of people in the vans is 2 vans x 8 people per van = 16 people.\n\nIn the buses, there are 3 buses, and each bus has 20 people. So, the total number of people in the buses is 3 buses x 20 people per bus = 60 people.\n\nNow, we need to add the total number of people in the vans and buses to find the total number of people on the field trip.\n\nTotal people = 16 people (vans) + 60 people (buses) = 76 people.\n\nThe answer is 76 people.", "answer": 76, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/635.png"}
