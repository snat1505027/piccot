{"question": "The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g. The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g. How much heavier is a glass bottle than a plastic bottle?", "qid": "793", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight difference between a glass bottle and a plastic bottle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the weight of 4 glass bottles. We know that the weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g, so we can calculate the weight of 4 glass bottles by multiplying the weight of 3 glass bottles by 1.333 (since 4 is approximately 1.333 times 3).\n\n600 g \u00d7 1.333 \u2248 800 g\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of 5 plastic bottles. We know that the total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g, so we can calculate the weight of 5 plastic bottles by subtracting the weight of 4 glass bottles from the total weight.\n\n1 kg 50 g - 800 g \u2248 150 g\n\nNow we have the weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles. To find the weight difference between a glass bottle and a plastic bottle, we need to subtract the weight of a plastic bottle from the weight of a glass bottle.\n\nWeight of a glass bottle - Weight of a plastic bottle = Weight difference\n\n600 g - 150 g = 450 g\n\nThe weight difference between a glass bottle and a plastic bottle is 450 g.", "answer": 150, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/793.png"}
