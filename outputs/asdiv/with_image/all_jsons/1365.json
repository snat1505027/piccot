{"question": "Frank has a round tablecloth with a diameter of 10 feet. What is the tablecloth's radius?", "qid": "1365", "response": "To find the radius of the tablecloth, we need to use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is C = 2\u03c0r. Since the diameter is given as 10 feet, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2.\n\n10 feet \u00f7 2 = 5 feet\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the radius:\n\nC = 2\u03c0r\n\n2\u03c0r = 10 feet\n\n\u03c0r = 10 feet \u00f7 2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0r = 5 feet \u00f7 2\u03c0\n\nr = 5 feet \u00f7 2\u03c0\n\nr = 2.5 feet\n\nThe answer is 2.5 feet.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1365.png"}
