{"question": "A club has 16 girls and 8 boys as members. The president wants to break the club into groups, with each group containing the same combination of girls and boys. The president also wants to make sure that no one is left out. What is the greatest number of groups the president can make? ", "qid": "1809", "response": "To find the greatest number of groups, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and boys. The GCD of 16 and 8 is 8.\n\nSince the president wants to make sure that no one is left out, we need to ensure that each group has at least one girl and one boy. We can do this by dividing the number of girls and boys by 8, which gives us 2 groups for girls and 2 groups for boys.\n\nThe total number of groups is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1809.png"}
