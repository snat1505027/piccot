{"question": "Wilson has a number in mind. If he takes away one-third of the number from it the result is sixteen-third. Find the number.", "qid": "1196", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the original number that Wilson has in mind. We know that if he takes away one-third of the number, the result is sixteen-third.\n\nFirst, we need to find the result of taking away one-third of the number. To do this, we can use the following equation:\n\n(Number) - 1/3 = 16/3\n\nNow, we can solve for the number by reversing the equation:\n\nNumber = (16/3) + 1/3\n\nNumber = 24/3\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:\n\nNumber = 8/1\n\nSo, the original number Wilson has in mind is 8.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1196.png"}
