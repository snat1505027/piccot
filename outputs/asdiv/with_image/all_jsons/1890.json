{"question": "At band practice there were 4 rows of students with 8 students in each row and then another 9 students in the back. How many students were there total?", "qid": "1890", "response": "To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of students in each row and the number of students in the back.\n\nThere are 4 rows of students, and each row has 8 students. So, the total number of students in the rows is 4 x 8 = <<4*8=32>>32.\n\nIn addition to the students in the rows, there are 9 students in the back. So, the total number of students is 32 + 9 = <<32+9=41>>41.\n\nThe answer is 41.", "answer": 41, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1890.png"}
