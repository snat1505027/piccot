{"question": "Catherine has 18 bottle caps and 19 blocks. If she shares the bottle caps among 6 friends, how many bottle caps does each friend get?", "qid": "2086", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bottle caps per friend. First, we need to find the total number of bottle caps Catherine has. We can do this by adding the number of bottle caps and blocks she has: 18 bottle caps + 19 blocks = 37.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of friends Catherine is sharing the bottle caps with. In this case, there are 6 friends.\n\nTo find the number of bottle caps per friend, we need to divide the total number of bottle caps by the total number of friends: 37 bottle caps \u00f7 6 friends = 6.17 bottle caps per friend.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bottle cap, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round 6.17 down to 6 bottle caps per friend.\n\nThe answer is 6 bottle caps per friend.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2086.png"}
