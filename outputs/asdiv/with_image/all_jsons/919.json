{"question": "Anthony gets 75 cents every day for lunch. He bought a juice box for 27 cents. He also bought a cupcake. Anthony had 8 cents left. How much did the cupcake cost?", "qid": "919", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the cupcake. We know that Anthony had 8 cents left, so we can set up an equation:\n\nCost of cupcake + 8 cents = 75 cents\n\nNow, we need to find the cost of the cupcake. To do this, we can subtract 8 cents from 75 cents:\n\nCost of cupcake = 75 cents - 8 cents\n\nCost of cupcake = 67 cents\n\nThe answer is 67 cents.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/919.png"}
