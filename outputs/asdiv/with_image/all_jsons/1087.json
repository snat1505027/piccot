{"question": "Jeremy has two pieces of wood: one is 90 inches and the other is 72 inches. He wants to cut both pieces of wood into smaller pieces so that all these pieces are the same length. How long does he cut the both pieces of wood?", "qid": "1087", "response": "To find the length of the smaller pieces, we need to find the average length of the two pieces of wood.\n\nFirst, we add the lengths of the two pieces of wood: 90 + 72 = 162 inches.\n\nThen, we divide the sum by 2 to find the average length: 162 / 2 = 81 inches.\n\nSince the answer is not an exact number, we can round it to the nearest whole number. The answer is 81 inches.\n\nTo cut the pieces of wood into smaller pieces of this length, Jeremy should cut each piece into 81-inch pieces.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1087.png"}
