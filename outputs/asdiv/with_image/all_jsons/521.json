{"question": "A baker has a pan of fudge that measures 18 inches on one side and 29 inches on another side. If the fudge is cut into square pieces 1 inch on each side, how many pieces of fudge does the pan hold?", "qid": "521", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the pan and then divide it by the area of each square piece of fudge.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the pan. The pan measures 18 inches on one side and 29 inches on another side. We can find the area of the pan by multiplying the length of one side by the length of the other side:\n\n18 inches \u00d7 29 inches = 552 square inches\n\nNext, we need to find the area of each square piece of fudge. Since each piece is 1 inch on each side, the area of each piece is:\n\n1 inch \u00d7 1 inch = 1 square inch\n\nNow, we can divide the total area of the pan by the area of each square piece of fudge to find the number of pieces:\n\n552 square inches \u00f7 1 square inch per piece = 552 pieces\n\nThe answer is 552.", "answer": 522, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/521.png"}
