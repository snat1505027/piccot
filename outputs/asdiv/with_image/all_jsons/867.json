{"question": "Martin works at the Hungry Hippo. He sells 48 hamburgers before 6 o'clock. He sells 28 more hamburgers than that after 6 o'clock. He works 24 hours each week. How many hamburgers does Martin sell after 6 o'clock?", "qid": "867", "response": "First, we need to find the number of hamburgers Martin sells after 6 o'clock. The image shows that he sells 28 more hamburgers than the number of hamburgers he sells before 6 o'clock. So, we can find the number of hamburgers he sells after 6 o'clock by adding 28 to the number of hamburgers he sells before 6 o'clock.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of hamburgers Martin sells each week. The image shows that he works 24 hours each week, and we know that he sells 48 hamburgers before 6 o'clock. To find the total number of hamburgers he sells each week, we need to multiply the number of hamburgers he sells after 6 o'clock by the number of hours he works each week.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of hamburgers per hour by dividing the total number of hamburgers by the number of hours he works each week.\n\nThe answer is: Martin sells 28 more hamburgers after 6 o'clock, making a total of 48 + 28 = <<48+28=76>>76 hamburgers. He works 24 hours each week, so he sells 76 / 24 = <<76/24=3.125>>3.125 hamburgers per hour.", "answer": 76, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/867.png"}
