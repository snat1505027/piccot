{"question": "Zoe's school sold 620 dollars in raffle tickets. If each ticket cost 4 dollars, how many tickets did they sell?", "qid": "1430", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tickets sold. We know that the total money raised from the raffle is $620, and each ticket costs $4. We can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the total money raised and the number of tickets sold.\n\nLet's call the number of tickets sold \"x\". We can write the proportion as:\n\nx \\* $4 = $620\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"x\". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $4:\n\nx = $620 / $4\n\nx = 155\n\nSo, Zoe's school sold 155 tickets.\n\nThe answer is 155.", "answer": 155, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1430.png"}
