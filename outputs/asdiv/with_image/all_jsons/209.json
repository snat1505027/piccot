{"question": "If the group was able to make 65 recycled materials from what they gathered and the teachers were able to make 28, how many recycled products will they be able to sell at the fair?", "qid": "209", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of recycled materials made by both the group and the teachers. We can do this by adding the number of materials made by the group and the teachers.\n\n65 (group) + 28 (teachers) = 93\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of recycled products they will be able to sell at the fair. We can do this by multiplying the total number of recycled materials by the number of products they can make from each material.\n\n93 (total recycled materials) x 1 (number of products per material) = 93\n\nThe answer is 93.", "answer": 93, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/209.png"}
