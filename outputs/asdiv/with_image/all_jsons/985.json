{"question": "Last year, Springtown Hardware ordered 3 hammers in June, 4 hammers in July, 6 hammers in August, and 9 hammers in September. If this pattern continues, how many hammers will the store order in October?", "qid": "985", "response": "To find the number of hammers ordered in October, we need to find the total number of hammers ordered in the first three months and then add the number of hammers ordered in October.\n\nIn the image, the number of hammers ordered in each month is shown:\n\n* June: 3 hammers\n* July: 4 hammers\n* August: 6 hammers\n* September: 9 hammers\n\nTo find the total number of hammers ordered in the first three months, we add the number of hammers ordered in each month:\n\n3 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 18\n\nNow, we need to find the number of hammers ordered in October. Since the pattern continues, we can assume that the number of hammers ordered in October will be the same as the total number of hammers ordered in the first three months.\n\nThe answer is 18.", "answer": 13, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/985.png"}
