How many folders did Nancy end up with?", "qid": "2017", "response": "Nancy had forty-three files on her computer, and she deleted thirty-one of them. This means she was left with twelve files. She put these twelve files into six folders, each containing two files.\n\nTo find the number of folders, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the twelve files into six folders. We can do this by using the combination formula:\n\nC(12, 6) = 12! / (6! \\* (12 - 6)!) = 220\n\nTherefore, Nancy ended up with twenty-two folders.\n\nThe answer is 22.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2017.png"}
