{"question": "A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?", "qid": "760", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of large barrels that can hold the remaining oil after filling the large barrels.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total capacity of large barrels:\n6 tons of oil per large barrel \u00d7 5 large barrels = 30 tons of oil\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of large barrels required to hold the remaining oil:\n95 tons of oil - 30 tons of oil = 65 tons of oil\n\nSince we need to use the least number of barrels, we can fill the remaining 65 tons of oil in 65/30 = 2.17 large barrels.\n\nHowever, we cannot have a fraction of a barrel, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number of large barrels. Therefore, we should use 3 large barrels to hold the remaining oil.\n\nThe answer is 3 large barrels.", "answer": 15, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/760.png"}
