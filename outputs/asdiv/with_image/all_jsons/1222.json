{"question": "If one round costs $80, how many rounds of golf can you play with $400?", "qid": "1222", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rounds of golf that can be played with $400, given that one round costs $80.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much money is available for golf. We have $400, and we need to subtract the cost of one round from it.\n\n$400 - $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320\n\nNext, we need to divide the amount of money available for golf by the cost of one round to find out the number of rounds that can be played.\n\n$320 \u00f7 $80 = <<320/80=4>>4\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1222.png"}
