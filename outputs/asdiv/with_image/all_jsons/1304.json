{"question": "The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees. Find them.", "qid": "1304", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the two supplementary angles. We can start by looking at the image, which shows a smaller angle and a larger angle. The larger angle is 18 degrees greater than the smaller angle.\n\nLet's denote the smaller angle as x and the larger angle as y. We can write the equation:\n\ny = x + 18\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = y - 18\n\nWe can simplify the equation by moving the 18 to the right side:\n\nx = y - 18\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for y in terms of x:\n\nx = (x + 18) - 18\n\nx = x + 18 - 18\n\nx = x + 18\n\nWe can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\nx = 18\n\nNow that we have found the value of x, we can substitute it back into the original equation to find the value of y:\n\ny = x + 18\n\ny = 18 + 18\n\ny = 36\n\nThe answer is 36.", "answer": 99, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1304.png"}
