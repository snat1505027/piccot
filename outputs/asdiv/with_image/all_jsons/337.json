{"question": "Since pizza is a favorite in Kevin's family, they also bought some. His sister bought 48 slices of pizza and his brother bought 48 as well. How many slices of pizza do they have for their neighbors if the family already ate 27 slices?", "qid": "337", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of slices of pizza that the family has. We can do this by adding the number of slices bought by Kevin's sister and brother.\n\n48 slices of pizza bought by sister + 48 slices of pizza bought by brother = Total number of slices\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of slices that the family has already eaten from the total number of slices.\n\nTotal number of slices - 27 slices eaten by family = Number of slices left for neighbors\n\nNow, we can solve the equation to find the number of slices left for neighbors.\n\n48 + 48 - 27 = 75\n\nThe answer is 75.", "answer": 69, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/337.png"}
