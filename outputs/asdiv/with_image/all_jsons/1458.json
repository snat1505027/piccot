{"question": "A rectangle flower bed had a total area of 35 square yards. If it was 5 yards wide, how long was it?", "qid": "1458", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the flower bed. We know that the total area of the flower bed is 35 square yards and it is 5 yards wide. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the length:\n\nlength x width = area\n\nFirst, we need to find the length. We can do this by dividing the total area by the width:\n\nlength = area / width\nlength = 35 / 5\nlength = 7\n\nSo, the length of the flower bed is 7 yards.\n\nThe answer is 7 yards.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1458.png"}
