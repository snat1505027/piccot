{"question": "Whitney has collected 4 T-shirts and 20 buttons from her favorite band. She wants to combine them into identical sets to sell, with no pieces left over. What is the greatest number of sets Whitney can make?", "qid": "1067", "response": "To find the greatest number of sets Whitney can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of T-shirts and buttons.\n\nThe T-shirts are 4, and the buttons are 20.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of each number:\n\n4 = 2^2\n20 = 2^2 \\* 5\n\nNext, we find the prime factors of the product of the T-shirts and buttons:\n\n(4 \\* 20) = 2^2 \\* 2^2 \\* 5\n\nNow, we multiply the prime factors to find the GCD:\n\n2^2 \\* 2^2 \\* 5 = 2^4 \\* 5 = 1024\n\nThe greatest number of sets Whitney can make is 1024.\n\nThe answer is 1024.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1067.png"}
