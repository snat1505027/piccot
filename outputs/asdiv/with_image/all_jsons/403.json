{"question": "Mayor Harvey wanted to add color to the party. He bought 7 flowers each representing the 7 colors of the rainbow. If he had 70 bouquets of flowers for each color, how many bouquets are there in all?", "qid": "403", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of bouquets. The image shows that there are 7 colors of the rainbow, and each color has 70 bouquets. We can find the total number of bouquets by multiplying the number of colors by the number of bouquets per color.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of colors. There are 7 colors in the rainbow, so we can write that as 7.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of bouquets per color. There are 70 bouquets per color, so we can write that as 70.\n\nNow, we can multiply the number of colors by the number of bouquets per color to find the total number of bouquets:\n\n7 (colors) \\* 70 (bouquets per color) = 490\n\nThe answer is 490.", "answer": 490, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/403.png"}
