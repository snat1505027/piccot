We know that 39 students got on the bus at the first stop.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of students at the second stop. We know that 29 more students got on the bus at the second stop.\n\nNow, we need to add the number of students from both stops to find the total number of students riding the bus.\n\n39 students at the first stop + 29 students at the second stop = 68 students riding the bus.\n\nThe answer is 68.", "answer": 68, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/225.png"}
