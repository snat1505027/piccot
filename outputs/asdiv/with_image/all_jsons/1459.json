{"question": "Faye was cutting out some fabric for a friend. She cut a piece that was 3 centimeters wide and had an area of 24 square centimeters. How long was the piece?", "qid": "1459", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the fabric piece. We know that the width of the piece is 3 centimeters and the area is 24 square centimeters. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the length:\n\nArea = width x length\n\nSince the area is 24 square centimeters, we can set up the equation:\n\n24 = 3 x length\n\nNow, we need to solve for the length. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n8 = length\n\nThe answer is 8 centimeters.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1459.png"}
