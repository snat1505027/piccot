{"question": "An electrician cuts a 30 ft piece of wire into two pieces. One piece is 2 ft longer than the other. How long are the pieces?", "qid": "1314", "response": "The electrician cuts the 30 ft piece of wire into two pieces. Let's call the shorter piece x ft and the longer piece (x+2) ft.\n\nThe total length of the wire is 30 ft, so we can write:\nx + (x+2) = 30\n\nTo solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:\nx + x + 2 = 30\n2x + 2 = 30\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by subtracting 2 from both sides:\n2x = 28\n\nTo find x, we can divide both sides by 2:\nx = 14\n\nSo, the shorter piece of wire is 14 ft long, and the longer piece is 16 ft long. The answer is x = 14 ft and (x+2) = 16 ft.", "answer": 14, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1314.png"}
