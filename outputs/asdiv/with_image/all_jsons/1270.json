{"question": "A is two years older than B. A's father D is twice as old as A and B is twice old as his sister C. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. Find the ages of A and B.", "qid": "1270", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the image. The image shows a table with the ages of A, B, D, and C.\n\n1. A is two years older than B.\n2. D is twice as old as A and B is twice as old as his sister C.\n3. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years.\n\nLet's start by finding the age of A. Since A is two years older than B, we can find the age of B by subtracting two years from A's age.\n\nA = 40 + 2 = 42\nB = 42 - 2 = 40\n\nNext, we can find the age of D by multiplying A's age by 2.\n\nD = 42 \\* 2 = 84\n\nNow, we can find the age of C by subtracting the age of D from the age of B.\n\nC = 40 - 84 = -44\n\nSince the ages of D and C differ by 40 years, we can find the age of C by adding 40 years to the age of D.\n\nC = 84 + 40 = 124\n\nFinally, we can find the age of B by subtracting the age of C from the age of B.\n\nB = 40 - 124 = -84\n\nThe answer is A is 42 years old, B is 40 years old, D is 84 years old, and C is 124 years old.", "answer": 26, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1270.png"}
