{"question": "Tom has to sell eight hundred forty-nine chocolate bars to win a trip. If each box contains five chocolate bars, how many boxes will he need to sell to win the trip?", "qid": "1379", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chocolate bars in each box and the total number of chocolate bars in the boxes.\n\n1. Number of chocolate bars in each box: 5\n2. Total number of chocolate bars in the boxes: 849\n\nNow, we need to find the number of boxes he needs to sell to win the trip. To do this, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of chocolate bars in each box.\n\n849 chocolate bars \u00f7 5 chocolate bars per box = 169.8 boxes\n\nSince we cannot sell a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of boxes.\n\n169.8 boxes rounded up to the nearest whole number of boxes = 170 boxes\n\nThe answer is 170 boxes.", "answer": 170, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1379.png"}
