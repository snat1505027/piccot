Ninety-three cloves can be written as 93, and eighty-six cloves can be written as 86.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of cloves used (86) from the total number of cloves stored (93):\n\n93 - 86 = 7\n\nTherefore, Maria has seven cloves of garlic left.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1737.png"}
