{"question": "The perimeter of a hexagonal display board is 42 cm. The board has to be bordered around with satin ribbon. Find the length of ribbon required to border each side.", "qid": "1210", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of ribbon required to border each side of the hexagonal display board. The perimeter of the board is given as 42 cm.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of each side of the hexagon. Since the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by the number of sides. In this case, there are six sides.\n\n42 cm / 6 = 7 cm\n\nNow, we need to find the length of ribbon required to border each side. Since the ribbon is to be bordered around the entire hexagon, we need to multiply the length of the ribbon by the number of sides.\n\nLength of ribbon per side = 7 cm x 6 = 42 cm\n\nThe answer is 42 cm.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1210.png"}
