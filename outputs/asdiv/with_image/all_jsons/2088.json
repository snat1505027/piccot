{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 11 classrooms. There are 100 students in the school and 20 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?", "qid": "2088", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of buses needed to transport all the students.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of students per bus. We can do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus:\n\n100 students \u00f7 20 seats per bus = 5 buses\n\n2. Now, we know that there are 11 classrooms, and we need to transport all the students. However, we have already calculated that we need 5 buses to transport the students. Since there are 11 classrooms and 5 buses, we need to find out how many students are in each classroom.\n\n3. To find the number of students per classroom, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms:\n\n100 students \u00f7 11 classrooms = 9.09 students per classroom (rounded up to 10 students)\n\n4. Since we have 10 students per classroom, we can now find the number of buses needed to transport all the students. We can do this by multiplying the number of classrooms by the number of students per classroom:\n\n11 classrooms \u00d7 10 students per classroom = 110 students\n\n5. We already know that we need 5 buses to transport the students. To find the number of buses needed, we can divide the total number of students by the number of buses:\n\n110 students \u00f7 5 buses = 22 students per bus\n\n6. Since we have 22 students per bus, we can now find the number of buses needed to transport all the students. We can do this by multiplying the number of students by the number of buses:\n\n110 students \u00d7 5 buses = 550 students\n\nThe answer is 5 buses.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2088.png"}
