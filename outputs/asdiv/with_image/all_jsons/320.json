She divided her crew into 3 teams. If the first team made 235, and the second made 275, how many pies should the third team make?", "qid": "320", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pies the third team should make to reach the total of 750 mini meat pies.\n\nFirst, we add the number of pies made by the first and second teams: 235 + 275 = 510.\n\nThen, we subtract this total from the total needed: 750 - 510 = 240.\n\nSince the third team is the last one, they should make the remaining 240 mini meat pies.\n\nThe answer is 240.", "answer": 240, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/320.png"}
