{"question": "Two years ago, a father was five times as old as his son. Two years later, his age will be 8 more than the age of the son. Find the present ages of father and son.", "qid": "1271", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the image. The image shows a series of equations representing the relationship between the father's age and the son's age over time.\n\nLet's start by looking at the first equation: \"Two years ago, a father was five times as old as his son.\" This means that the father's age was five times the son's age two years ago. We can represent this as:\n\nFather's age (2 years ago) = 5 \\* Son's age (2 years ago)\n\nNext, we can look at the second equation: \"Two years later, his age will be 8 more than the age of the son.\" This means that the father's age will be 8 years more than the son's age two years later. We can represent this as:\n\nFather's age (2 years later) = Son's age (2 years later) + 8\n\nNow we have two equations that we can use to solve for the present ages of the father and son. We can set up a system of equations using the information from the image:\n\n1. Father's age (2 years ago) = 5 \\* Son's age (2 years ago)\n2. Son's age (2 years later) = Son's age (2 years ago) + 2\n3. Father's age (2 years later) = Son's age (2 years later) + 8\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution to solve for the present ages of the father and son.\n\nFirst, we can solve equation 2 for Son's age (2 years later):\n\nSon's age (2 years later) = Son's age (2 years ago) + 2\nSon's age (2 years ago) = Son's age (2 years later) - 2\n\nNext, we can substitute the expression for Son's age (2 years ago) into equation 1:\n\nFather's age (2 years ago) = 5 \\* (Son's age (2 years later) - 2)\n\nNow we have an equation that relates the father's age (2 years ago) to the son's age (2 years later).
