{"question": "Bianca wanted to drink exactly 5 bottles of water each day, so she bought 47 bottles when they were on sale. How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?", "qid": "1113", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bottles of water Bianca needs on the last day. Let's start by looking at the image.\n\n1. The image shows that Bianca needs 47 bottles of water per day.\n2. There are 5 bottles of water per day.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more bottles she will need on the last day. To do this, we can use the following equation:\n\nNumber of bottles needed on the last day = Number of bottles needed per day - Number of bottles already bought\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\nNumber of bottles needed on the last day = 5 - 47\n\nNow, let's solve the equation:\n\nNumber of bottles needed on the last day = 5 - 47\nNumber of bottles needed on the last day = -42\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of bottles, we can conclude that Bianca already has enough bottles of water for the last day. She does not need to buy any more bottles.\n\nThe answer is: Bianca does not need to buy any more bottles on the last day.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1113.png"}
