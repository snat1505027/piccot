{"question": "Rachel bought seven new chairs and three new tables for her house. If she spent four minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes did it take her to finish?", "qid": "2009", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total time spent on putting together all the furniture. We can do this by multiplying the number of chairs by the time spent on each chair and the number of tables by the time spent on each table. Then, we add the results to find the total time spent.\n\nThere are seven chairs, and it took four minutes to put together each chair. So, the total time spent on the chairs is 7 x 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 minutes.\n\nThere are three tables, and it took four minutes to put together each table. So, the total time spent on the tables is 3 x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 minutes.\n\nThe total time spent on all the furniture is the sum of the time spent on the chairs and the time spent on the tables: 28 + 12 = <<28+12=40>>40 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 40 minutes.", "answer": 40, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2009.png"}
