{"question": "A store has thirty-five shirts. If they sold thirty of them, how many shirts would they have? ", "qid": "1738", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. The image shows a chart with the number of shirts in the store and the number of shirts sold. We can see that there are 35 shirts in the store and 30 shirts have been sold.\n\nTo find the answer, we need to subtract the number of shirts sold from the number of shirts in the store. We can do this by using the following equation:\n\nShirts left in store = Shirts in store - Shirts sold\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\nShirts left in store = 35 - 30\n\nSolving the equation, we get:\n\nShirts left in store = 5\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1738.png"}
