Billy had forty-eight tickets initially.\n2. After buying the yoyo, he had thirty-two tickets left.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many tickets the yoyo cost. To do this, we can use the number of tickets Billy had left after buying the yoyo and divide it by the number of tickets he had initially.\n\n32 tickets left \u00f7 48 tickets initially = 0.6667\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a ticket, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe answer is 1 ticket.", "answer": 16, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1724.png"}
