{"question": "For the frosting and final touches, Willie will need to have 300 lbs. of whipped cream. If he got 149 lbs. of cream from his farm, how much more cream is needed to be bought?", "qid": "314", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to subtract the amount of whipped cream Willie got from his farm (149 lbs) from the total amount needed for frosting and final touches (300 lbs).\n\n149 lbs - 300 lbs = -151 lbs\n\nSince the result is negative, it means that Willie already has more whipped cream than he needs. Therefore, he does not need to buy any more whipped cream.\n\nThe answer is 0 lbs.", "answer": 151, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/314.png"}
