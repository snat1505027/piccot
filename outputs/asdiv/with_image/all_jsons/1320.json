{"question": "Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 3 times as large as the first. How large are the angles?", "qid": "1320", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. The image shows that the first angle is equal to the second angle, and the third angle is three times as large as the first angle.\n\nLet's start by labeling the angles:\n\n1. First angle: x\n2. Second angle: x\n3. Third angle: 3x\n\nWe can use the fact that the first and second angles are equal to write:\n\nx = x\n\nNow, we can substitute the second angle with the first angle in the equation for the third angle:\n\n3x = 3(x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3x = 3x\n\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, we can conclude that:\n\nx = x\n\nThis means that the first and second angles are equal, and the third angle is three times as large as the first angle.\n\nThe answer is x = x.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1320.png"}
