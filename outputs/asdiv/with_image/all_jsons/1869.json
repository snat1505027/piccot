{"question": "Tim has a bag of 36 orange-flavoured sweets and Peter has a bag of 44 grape-flavoured sweets. They have to divide up the sweets into small trays with equal number of sweets; each tray containing either orange-flavoured or grape-flavoured sweets only. If there is no remainder, what is the largest possible number of sweets in each tray?", "qid": "1869", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest number of sweets that can be divided evenly between the two bags. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of sweets in each bag.\n\nThe number of sweets in Tim's bag is 36, and in Peter's bag, it is 44. To find the LCM, we need to multiply both numbers together and then find the highest power of 2 that divides the product evenly.\n\n36 x 44 = 1624\n\nThe highest power of 2 that divides 1624 evenly is 2^7, which gives us 128.\n\nSo, the largest number of sweets that can be divided evenly between the two bags is 128.\n\nThe answer is 128.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1869.png"}
