{"question": "The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?", "qid": "791", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades. We can start by finding the weight of 4 diamonds, which is 100 g. Then, we can find the weight of 2 jades by adding 100 g to the weight of 4 diamonds.\n\n100 g + 100 g = 200 g\n\nNow we have the weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades, which is 200 g. To find the difference in weight between a jade and a diamond, we can subtract the weight of 4 diamonds from the weight of 2 jades.\n\n200 g - 100 g = 100 g\n\nThe weight of a jade is 100 g heavier than a diamond. The answer is 100 g.", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/791.png"}
