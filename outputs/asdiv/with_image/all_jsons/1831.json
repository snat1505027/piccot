{"question": "Jazmin is completing an art project. She has two pieces of construction paper. The first piece is 44 inches wide and the second piece is 33 inches wide. Jazmin wants to cut the paper into strips that are equal in width and are as wide as possible. How wide should Jazmin cut each strip?", "qid": "1831", "response": "To find the width of each strip, we need to find the average width of the two pieces of construction paper.\n\nFirst, we add the widths of the two pieces of paper: 44 + 33 = 77 inches.\n\nThen, we divide the total width by the number of strips we want to cut: 77 \u00f7 2 = 38.5 inches.\n\nSince we want the strips to be as wide as possible, we need to round up the width of each strip to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe answer is 40 inches.", "answer": 11, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1831.png"}
