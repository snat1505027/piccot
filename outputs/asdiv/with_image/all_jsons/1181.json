{"question": "Nick and Kane were born on consecutive years and on same date. Nick is younger.  The sum of their ages is 11. Find the age of the brothers.", "qid": "1181", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the image. The image shows a diagram with the ages of Nick and Kane, which are 11 and 12, respectively. Since Nick is younger, we can conclude that the sum of their ages is 11.\n\nTo find the age of the brothers, we can use the following equation:\n\nAge of Nick + Age of Kane = 11\n\nWe know that the age of Nick is 11 - 12 = -1. However, ages cannot be negative, so we can conclude that the ages of the brothers are not consistent with the given information.\n\nThe answer is that the ages of the brothers cannot be determined based on the given information.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1181.png"}
