{"question": "For Halloween Will got fifteen pounds of candy. After giving some to Haley, he had nine pounds left. How many pounds did he give to Haley? ", "qid": "1669", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pounds of candy Will gave to Haley. We can do this by subtracting the amount of candy he had left from the total amount of candy he had.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the number of pounds to a decimal. Fifteen pounds is equal to 15.0 pounds.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the amount of candy he had left from the total amount of candy he had. Nine pounds is equal to 9.0 pounds.\n\nSo, we can write the equation as:\n\n15.0 - 9.0 = x\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 9.0 to both sides of the equation:\n\n15.0 + 9.0 = x\n\n24.0 = x\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 24.0 to get the answer in pounds:\n\nx/24.0 = 0.96\n\nThe answer is 0.96 pounds.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1669.png"}
