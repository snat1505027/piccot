{"question": "Anne had 15 Sweettarts. If Anne gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 3 friends, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?", "qid": "2056", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of Sweettarts each person ate. We know that Anne had 15 Sweettarts and gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 3 friends. Let's call the number of Sweettarts each person ate \"x\".\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the problem:\n\n15 Sweettarts - 3x Sweettarts = 3x Sweettarts\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n15 - 3x = 3x\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n5x = 15\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, each person ate 3 Sweettarts.\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2056.png"}
