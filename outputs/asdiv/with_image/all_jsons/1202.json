{"question": "A rectangular cupboard is of length 6 m and perimeter 20 m. Find the width of the cupboard.", "qid": "1202", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nWe are given that the perimeter of the cupboard is 20 m and its length is 6 m. We can use these values to find the width:\n\n20 = 2L + 2W\n20 = 2(6) + 2W\n20 = 12 + 2W\n\nNow, we can solve for W:\n\n20 - 12 = 2W\n8 = 2W\n\nTo find the width, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n4 = W\n\nThe width of the cupboard is 4 meters.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1202.png"}
