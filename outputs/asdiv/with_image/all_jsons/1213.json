{"question": "A rectangular swimming pool was constructed for Kids at Hotel Park. The length of the swimming pool is twice its width. If the length is 16 ft, find the width and area of the pool.", "qid": "1213", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. The length of the swimming pool is 16 feet, and it is twice its width. Let's start by finding the width of the pool.\n\n1. First, we need to find the width of the pool. Since the length is 16 feet, we can divide it by 2 to find the width:\n\n16 / 2 = 8\n\nThe width of the pool is 8 feet.\n\n2. Now that we have the width, we can find the area of the pool. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and width:\n\nArea = length x width\n\nArea = 16 x 8\n\nArea = 128 square feet\n\nThe answer is 128 square feet.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1213.png"}
