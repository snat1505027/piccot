{"question": "A boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.", "qid": "1288", "response": "First, we need to find the speed of the boat in still water. To do this, we can use the equation:\n\nSpeed of the boat in still water = (Distance upstream + Distance downstream) / Total time\n\nIn this case, the total time is 10 hours. The distance upstream is 30 km, and the distance downstream is 44 km. So, the speed of the boat in still water is:\n\nSpeed of the boat in still water = (30 + 44) / 10 = 74 km/h\n\nNext, we need to find the speed of the stream. To do this, we can use the equation:\n\nSpeed of the stream = (Distance upstream - Distance downstream) / Total time\n\nIn this case, the total time is 13 hours. The distance upstream is 40 km, and the distance downstream is 55 km. So, the speed of the stream is:\n\nSpeed of the stream = (40 - 55) / 13 = -16.15 km/h\n\nSince the speed of the stream is negative, it means the boat is moving against the current. The answer is:\n\nThe boat's speed in still water is 74 km/h, and the speed of the stream is -16.15 km/h.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1288.png"}
