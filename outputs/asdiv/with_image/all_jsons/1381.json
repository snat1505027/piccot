{"question": "Robin wanted to drink exactly nine bottles of water each day, so she bought six hundred seventeen bottles when they were on sale. How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?", "qid": "1381", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bottles Robin needs to drink on the last day. We can do this by dividing the total number of bottles she has by the number of days she has left.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many days Robin has left. Since she already has 671 bottles, we can assume that she has already consumed some of them. Let's say she has consumed 600 bottles, leaving her with 71 bottles.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many bottles she needs to drink on the last day. We can do this by dividing the remaining bottles by the number of days left.\n\nNumber of bottles on the last day = 71 bottles / 1 day = 71 bottles\n\nThe answer is 71 bottles.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1381.png"}
