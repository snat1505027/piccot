{"question": "A clown had eighty-two balloons. After a party he had sixteen left. How many balloons did he use at the party? ", "qid": "1745", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of balloons the clown used at the party. We know that he had 82 balloons initially and 16 balloons left after the party. We can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\n82 - 16 = x\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 16 to both sides of the equation:\n\n82 + 16 = x + 16\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n98 = x + 16\n\nTo find x, we need to subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:\n\n98 - 16 = x\n\n82 = x\n\nThe answer is 82.", "answer": 66, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1745.png"}
