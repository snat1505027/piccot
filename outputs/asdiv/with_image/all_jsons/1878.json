{"question": "Fabric is sold in stores from bolts that are 45 or 60 inches wide. What is the width of the widest strips of fabric you can cut from either bolt without wasting any of the fabric if each strip has the same width?", "qid": "1878", "response": "To find the width of the widest strips of fabric, we need to find the smallest number that is a common multiple of both 45 and 60.\n\nFirst, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and 60, which is 15.\n\nNext, we can divide both 45 and 60 by 15 to find the smallest number that is a common multiple of both:\n\n45 \u00f7 15 = 3\n60 \u00f7 15 = 4\n\nSo, the smallest common multiple of 45 and 60 is 12.\n\nNow, we can find the width of the widest strips of fabric by dividing the smallest common multiple (12) by the GCD (15):\n\n12 \u00f7 15 = 0.8\n\nThe answer is 0.8 inches.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1878.png"}
