{"question": "Tess is writing a poem. She writes 23 words on the first line, 26 words on the second line, 29 words on the third line, 32 words on the fourth line, and 35 words on the fifth line. If this pattern continues, how many words will Tess write on the sixth line?", "qid": "1055", "response": "To find the number of words Tess will write on the sixth line, we need to find the pattern in the given sequence. The sequence is 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, and we can see that each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.\n\nSo, to find the number of words on the sixth line, we can add the previous two numbers: 35 + 32 = 67.\n\nThe answer is 67.", "answer": 38, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1055.png"}
