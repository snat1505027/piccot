How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?", "qid": "1355", "response": "To find the number of small pancakes, we need to convert the number of large pancakes to small pancakes. We can do this by dividing the number of large pancakes by the diameter of the small pancakes.\n\n8 large pancakes / 2 inches diameter of small pancakes = 4 small pancakes\n\nThe answer is 4 small pancakes.", "answer": 200, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1355.png"}
