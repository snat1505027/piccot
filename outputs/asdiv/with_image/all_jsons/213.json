{"question": "With the end of the month coming in two days, they decided to sell cookies to the neighboring villages as well. If they sold 23 packs on one village and 28 on the other, how many cookies were they able to sell in the other villages?", "qid": "213", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of packs sold in both villages. We can do this by adding the number of packs sold in each village.\n\n23 packs sold in one village + 28 packs sold in the other village = 51 packs sold in total\n\nNow, we need to find the number of cookies in each pack. Since we don't know the exact number of cookies in each pack, we can only estimate the number of cookies based on the total packs sold.\n\nLet's assume that each pack contains 10 cookies. In this case, the total number of cookies sold in both villages would be:\n\n51 packs sold in total \u00d7 10 cookies per pack = 510 cookies sold in total\n\nThe answer is 510 cookies.", "answer": 51, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/213.png"}
