{"question": "Two neon signs are turned on at the same time. both signs blink as they are turned on. One sign blinks every 9 seconds. The other sign blinks every 15 seconds. In how many seconds will they blink together again?", "qid": "1864", "response": "To find the time it takes for both signs to blink together, we need to find the common multiple of 9 and 15. The smallest common multiple is 45.\n\nThe first sign blinks every 9 seconds, so it will take 45 seconds for it to blink 5 times (9, 18, 27, 36, 45).\n\nThe second sign blinks every 15 seconds, so it will take 45 seconds for it to blink 3 times (15, 45, 75).\n\nSince both signs have blinked together 5 times in 45 seconds, they will blink together again in 45 seconds.\n\nThe answer is 45 seconds.", "answer": 45, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1864.png"}
