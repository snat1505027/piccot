{"question": "The difference of two numbers is 100.

The image shows a number line with the number 91 and the word \"difference\" written below it. We know that the difference between the two numbers is 100.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number that is 100 away from 91. To do this, we can count 100 units to the right of 91 on the number line. The next number after 91 is 100, so the other number is 100.\n\nThe answer is 100.", "answer": 191, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1190.png"}
