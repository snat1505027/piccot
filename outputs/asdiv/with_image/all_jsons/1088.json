{"question": "For a dinner party, Abraham is creating individual servings of starters. He has 9 carrot sticks and 18 celery sticks. If he wants each serving to be identical, with no food left over, what is the greatest number of servings Abraham can create?", "qid": "1088", "response": "To find the greatest number of servings, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9 and 18. The GCD of 9 and 18 is 1.\n\nSince the GCD is 1, we can divide both 9 and 18 by 1 to get the same result: 9 servings.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1088.png"}
