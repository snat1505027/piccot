{"question": "During Christmas a book store sold 72 books. If the ratio of books to bookmarks sold was 9:2, how many bookmarks did the store sell?", "qid": "1490", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bookmarks sold. We know that the ratio of books to bookmarks sold is 9:2, so we can set up a proportion equation. Let's call the number of bookmarks sold x.\n\nBooks sold: 72\nBookmarks sold: x\n\nWe know that the ratio is 9:2, so we can write the equation:\n\n72 / 9 = x / 2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n72 / 9 = 2x\n\n3x = 72\n\nx = 24\n\nThe store sold 24 bookmarks.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 16, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1490.png"}
