{"question": "Wendy's brother had 6 pieces of candy. Wendy had 2 boxes with 3 pieces each. How many pieces did they have total?", "qid": "1893", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy in the two boxes. Since each box contains 3 pieces of candy, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces in each box to find the total number of pieces in the two boxes.\n\n2 boxes x 3 pieces per box = 6 pieces of candy in the two boxes\n\nNext, we need to add the number of pieces of candy in the two boxes to the number of pieces that Wendy's brother had.\n\n6 pieces of candy in the two boxes + 6 pieces of candy = 12 pieces of candy\n\nThe answer is 12 pieces of candy.", "answer": 12, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1893.png"}
