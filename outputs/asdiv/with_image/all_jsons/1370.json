{"question": "A square piece of glass has an area of 64 square centimeters. How long is each side?", "qid": "1370", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the side length of the square piece of glass. We know that the area of the square is 64 square centimeters. We can use the formula for the area of a square to find the side length:\n\nArea = Side\u00b2\n\n64 = Side\u00b2\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 64, which is 8. Therefore, the side length of the square piece of glass is 8 centimeters.\n\nThe answer is 8 centimeters.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1370.png"}
