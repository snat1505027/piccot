{"question": "A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.", "qid": "1299", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image to create a system of equations.\n\nLet d be the distance covered by the train.\nLet s be the speed of the train.\nLet t be the scheduled time.\nLet a be the time taken if the train is faster by 6 km/hr.\nLet b be the time taken if the train is slower by 6 km/hr.\n\nFrom the image, we know that:\na = t - 8/s\nb = t + 12/s\n\nWe also know that:\nd = s \\* t\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for a and b into the distance equation:\nd = s \\* (t - 8/s) and d = s \\* (t + 12/s)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equations by canceling out the s terms:\nt - 8/s = t + 12/s\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\nt = (8/s) + (12/s)\nt = 20/s\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for t back into the distance equation:\nd = s \\* (20/s)\n\nNow, we can solve for s:\ns = d / 20\n\nFinally, we can substitute the expression for s back into the equation for t:\nt = (8/s) + (12/s)\nt = 20/s\n\nThe answer is d = s \\* (20/s) = 20 \\* 20 = 400.", "answer": 1440, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1299.png"}
