{"question": "A piece of square paper has a perimeter of 32 centimeters. Nicky's dog, Rocky, tore off 1/4 of the paper. What is the area of the remaining paper?", "qid": "1357", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each side of the square paper first. We can do this by dividing the perimeter by 4, since the paper has 4 sides.\n\n32 / 4 = 8\n\nNow, we know that the length of each side of the square paper is 8 centimeters. Next, we need to find the area of the remaining paper. Since Rocky tore off 1/4 of the paper, we can find the area by multiplying the length of each side by 1/4 and then by 1/2, since we are looking for the area of the remaining paper.\n\n8 / 4 = 2\n2 \\* 1/4 = 1/2\n1/2 \\* 1/2 = 1/4\n\nNow, we can find the area of the remaining paper by multiplying the length of each side by 1/4 and then by 1/2.\n\n2 \\* 1/4 \\* 1/2 = 1/4\n\nThe answer is 1/4 square centimeters.", "answer": 48, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1357.png"}
