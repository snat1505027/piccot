{"question": "A field is in the shape of an equilateral triangle attached to the width of the rectangular region where width of the rectangle and side of the triangle measures the same. The length of rectangular region is 76 ft and the side of triangular region measures 42 ft. Find the perimeter of the field.", "qid": "1217", "response": "To find the perimeter of the field, we need to find the length of the triangle and the length of the rectangle.\n\nThe triangle has a side length of 42 ft, and the rectangle has a width of 76 ft.\n\nThe length of the triangle can be found by using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n42^2 = (side of the triangle)^2 + (side of the rectangle)^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^2 = 42^2 + 76^2\n\n42^", "answer": 90, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1217.png"}
