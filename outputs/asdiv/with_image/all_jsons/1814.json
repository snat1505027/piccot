What is the greatest number of groups Lavinia can set out? ", "qid": "1814", "response": "To find the greatest number of groups Lavinia can set out, we need to divide the total number of glasses and mugs by the number of glasses in a group.\n\nThere are 9 glasses and 6 mugs in total.\n\nFirst, we will find the number of groups for the glasses:\n9 glasses \u00f7 9 glasses in a group = 1 group\n\nNext, we will find the number of groups for the mugs:\n6 mugs \u00f7 9 mugs in a group = 0.67 groups (rounded down to the nearest whole number)\n\nSince we need to set out identical groups, we can only set out 1 group of glasses and 0.67 groups of mugs.\n\nThe answer is 1 group of glasses and 0.67 groups of mugs.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1814.png"}
