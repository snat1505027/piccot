{"question": "Tripp and Charlotte are going on a 36 mile hike. Tripp's backpack weighs 25 pounds. Charlotte's back pack weighs 7 pounds less. They hiked 9 miles the first day. How many miles do they have left?", "qid": "869", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance they have hiked and the distance they have left to hike.\n\n1. Tripp's backpack weighs 25 pounds, and Charlotte's backpack weighs 7 pounds less, so Charlotte's backpack weighs 25 - 7 = 18 pounds.\n2. The total weight of both backpacks is 25 + 18 = 43 pounds.\n3. The distance they have hiked on the first day is 9 miles.\n4. The total distance they have hiked is 9 + 36 = 45 miles.\n5. The distance they have left to hike is 45 - 9 = 36 miles.\n\nThe answer is 36 miles.", "answer": 27, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/869.png"}
