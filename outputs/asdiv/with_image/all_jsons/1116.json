{"question": "A movie store had 9 movies they were putting on 2 shelves. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?", "qid": "1116", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of movies per shelf. We can do this by dividing the total number of movies by the number of shelves.\n\nThere are 9 movies in total.\nThe number of shelves is 2.\n\n9 movies \u00f7 2 shelves = 4.5 movies per shelf\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a movie, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n4.5 movies per shelf rounded up to the nearest whole number = 5 movies per shelf\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more movies the owner would need to make both shelves have the same number of movies.\n\nThe owner currently has 9 movies, and he wants to put 5 movies on each shelf.\n\n9 movies - 5 movies per shelf = 4 movies per shelf\n\nThe owner would need 5 movies per shelf - 4 movies per shelf = 1 more movie per shelf.\n\nThe answer is 1 more movie per shelf.", "answer": 1, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1116.png"}
