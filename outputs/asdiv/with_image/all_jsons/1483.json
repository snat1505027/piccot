{"question": "A rectangle swimming pool was 3 meters wide with a surface area of 30 square meters. What is the length of the pool?", "qid": "1483", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the pool. We know that the pool is 3 meters wide and has a surface area of 30 square meters. We can use the formula for the surface area of a rectangle to find the length of the pool.\n\nSurface area of a rectangle = width x length\n\nSince the pool is 3 meters wide, we can start by finding the width in meters. 3 meters = 300 centimeters.\n\nNow, we need to find the length of the pool. We know that the surface area of the pool is 30 square meters. To convert square meters to square centimeters, we multiply by 10,000. 30 square meters = 300,000 square centimeters.\n\nWe can now use the formula for the surface area of a rectangle:\n\n300,000 square centimeters = width x length\n\nTo find the length, we can divide both sides by the width:\n\nlength = 300,000 square centimeters / 300 square centimeters\n\nlength = 1000 square centimeters\n\nTo convert square centimeters to meters, we divide by 100:\n\nlength = 1000 square centimeters / 100\n\nlength = 10 square meters\n\nSince the pool is 3 meters wide, the length must be 3 times the width, which is 3 x 3 meters = 9 meters.\n\nThe answer is 9 meters.", "answer": 10, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1483.png"}
