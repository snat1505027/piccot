{"question": "Farmer Singleton has a plot of tomato plants. There are 4 tomato plants in the first row, 8 tomato plants in the second row, 16 tomato plants in the third row, 32 tomato plants in the fourth row, and 64 tomato plants in the fifth row. If this pattern continues, how many tomato plants will there be in the sixth row?", "qid": "996", "response": "To find the number of tomato plants in the sixth row, we need to identify the pattern in the number of plants in each row. The pattern is that the number of plants in each row increases by a factor of 2 compared to the previous row.\n\n1. First row: 4 plants\n2. Second row: 8 plants (double the number of plants in the first row)\n3. Third row: 16 plants (double the number of plants in the second row)\n4. Fourth row: 32 plants (double the number of plants in the third row)\n5. Fifth row: 64 plants (double the number of plants in the fourth row)\n\nTo find the number of plants in the sixth row, we need to double the number of plants in the fifth row:\n\n6. Sixth row: 64 plants \\* 2 = 128 plants\n\nThe answer is 128.", "answer": 128, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/996.png"}
