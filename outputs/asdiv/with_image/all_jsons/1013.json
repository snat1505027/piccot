{"question": "Cora sliced 18 kg of green apples for a party. She divided the apple slices equally between 5 large bowls. How many grams of apple slices did Cora put in each bowl?", "qid": "1013", "response": "First, we need to find the total weight of apple slices Cora put in all the bowls. We can do this by multiplying the number of large bowls by the weight of apple slices in each bowl.\n\n18 kg of apples divided by 5 large bowls = 3.6 kg of apple slices per bowl.\n\nNow, we need to convert the weight of apple slices from kilograms to grams. 1 kg is equal to 1000 grams.\n\n3.6 kg of apple slices per bowl = 3600 grams of apple slices per bowl.\n\nSince the image shows that Cora put 100 grams of apple slices in each bowl, we can find the number of bowls by dividing the total weight of apple slices by the weight of apple slices in each bowl.\n\n3600 grams of apple slices divided by 100 grams per bowl = 36 bowls.\n\nHowever, the image shows that there are only 5 large bowls. This means that Cora put 3 times the weight of apple slices in each bowl than what the image shows.\n\n3600 grams of apple slices divided by 3 times 100 grams per bowl = 1200 grams of apple slices per bowl.\n\nThe answer is 1200 grams of apple slices per bowl.", "answer": 3600, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1013.png"}
