{"question": "Another material that he needs is rope. If he already has 6 feet of rope and he needs additional ropes having 5 times the length of what he already have, how long should be the additional rope?", "qid": "361", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the additional rope. We know that the length of the additional rope should be 5 times the length of the rope he already has.\n\nLet's start by finding the length of the rope he already has. We can do this by looking at the image, which shows that he already has 6 feet of rope.\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the additional rope. We know that the length of the additional rope should be 5 times the length of the rope he already has. We can represent this as:\n\nAdditional rope length = 5 x Rope length\n\nWe can substitute the length of the rope he already has for \"Road length\" in the equation:\n\nAdditional rope length = 5 x 6 feet\n\nAdditional rope length = 30 feet\n\nThe answer is 30 feet.", "answer": 30, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/361.png"}
