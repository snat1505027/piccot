{"question": "Shannon is making identical balloon arrangements for a party. She has 32 maroon balloons, 24 white balloons, and 16 orange balloons. She wants each arrangement to have the same number of each color. What is the greatest number of arrangements that she can make if every balloon is used?", "qid": "1094", "response": "To find the greatest number of arrangements, we need to distribute the total number of balloons (32 + 24 + 16 = 72) evenly among the three colors. Since we want each arrangement to have the same number of each color, we can divide the total number of balloons by the number of balloons in each color.\n\n32 maroon balloons \u00f7 1 balloon per arrangement = 32 arrangements\n24 white balloons \u00f7 1 balloon per arrangement = 24 arrangements\n16 orange balloons \u00f7 1 balloon per arrangement = 16 arrangements\n\nThe total number of arrangements is 32 + 24 + 16 = 72.\n\nThe answer is 72.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1094.png"}
