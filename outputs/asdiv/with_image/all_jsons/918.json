{"question": "Kate, Maggie, and Sue added up their ages. The total was 48. Kate is 19 and Maggie is 17. How old is Sue?", "qid": "918", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Sue. We know that Kate is 19 and Maggie is 17, so we can start by adding their ages together: 19 + 17 = 36.\n\nSince the total ages of Kate and Maggie are 36, and we know that Sue's age is also included in the total, we can deduce that Sue's age is the total minus the ages of Kate and Maggie: 48 - 36 = 12.\n\nThe answer is Sue is 12 years old.", "answer": 12, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/918.png"}
