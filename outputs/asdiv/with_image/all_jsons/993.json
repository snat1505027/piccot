{"question": "Steve is stacking cups; he put 17 plastic cups in the first stack, 21 plastic cups in the second stack, 25 plastic cups in the third stack, and 29 plastic cups in the fourth stack. If this pattern continues, how many plastic cups will Steve put in the fifth stack?", "qid": "993", "response": "To find the number of plastic cups in the fifth stack, we need to find the pattern in which the number of cups increases. The pattern is that the number of cups in each stack increases by 4.\n\n17 + 4 = 21\n21 + 4 = 25\n25 + 4 = 29\n\nTo find the number of cups in the fifth stack, we add 4 to 29:\n\n29 + 4 = 33\n\nThe answer is 33.", "answer": 33, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/993.png"}
