{"question": "Luke had 9 pieces of candy. If he wants to split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many more pieces would he need to make sure each bag had the same amount?", "qid": "1119", "response": "To split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, we need to find the average number of candies per bag.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of candies in the image. The image shows 9 candies.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of bags. The image shows 2 bags.\n\nNow, we can calculate the average number of candies per bag by dividing the total number of candies by the number of bags:\n\n9 candies \u00f7 2 bags = 4.5 candies per bag\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a candy, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of candies per bag.\n\n4.5 candies per bag rounded up to the nearest whole number is 5 candies per bag.\n\nTherefore, Luke would need 5 more pieces of candy to make sure each bag has the same amount.\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 1, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1119.png"}
