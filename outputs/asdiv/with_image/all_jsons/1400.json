{"question": "Each house a carpenter builds needs six sinks. If he bought two hundred sixty-six sinks, how many houses would that cover?", "qid": "1400", "response": "First, we need to find out how many sinks the carpenter has. In the image, there are two hundred sixty-six sinks.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many houses each sink can cover. In the image, it says that each house needs six sinks.\n\nNow, we can find out how many houses the carpenter can build using the sinks he has. To do this, we divide the number of sinks by the number of sinks per house:\n\n266 sinks / 6 sinks per house = 44.33 houses\n\nSince we cannot build a fraction of a house, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of houses. In this case, we round up to 45 houses.\n\nThe answer is 45 houses.", "answer": 44, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1400.png"}
