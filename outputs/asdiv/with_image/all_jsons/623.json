{"question": "Sara's mother gave her $69 to go to the store. Sara bought 3 loaves of bread and 5 cartons of orange juice. Each loaf of bread cost $2 and each carton of orange juice cost $3. How much money does Sara have left?", "qid": "623", "response": "To find out how much money Sara has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bread and the orange juice.\n\n3 loaves of bread cost: 3 x $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6\n5 cartons of orange juice cost: 5 x $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15\n\nThe total cost of the bread and the orange juice is $6 + $15 = $<<6+15=21>>21.\n\nSara has $69 to go to the store, so she has $69 - $21 = $<<69-21=48>>48 left.\n\nThe answer is $48.", "answer": 48, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/623.png"}
