We can use the information provided in the image to set up a proportion.\n\nLet's start by drawing a rectangle with a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet. We can then use the image to find the length of the ribbon.\n\nThe image shows that the length of the ribbon is equal to the length of the rectangle plus the width of the rectangle. In this case, the length of the ribbon is 20 feet + 15 feet = 35 feet.\n\nThe answer is 35 feet.", "answer": 70, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1343.png"}
