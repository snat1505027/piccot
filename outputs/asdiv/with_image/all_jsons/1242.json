{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 3 cups of sugar. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour does she need to add ?", "qid": "1242", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary needs to add to reach the total amount of flour required by the recipe.\n\nThe image shows that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour in total.\n\nTo find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added (2 cups) from the total amount of flour required (9 cups).\n\n2 cups - 9 cups = -7 cups\n\nSince we cannot have a negative amount of cups, we need to add the missing cups to the recipe.\n\n9 cups + 7 cups = 16 cups\n\nThe answer is 16 cups.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1242.png"}
