{"question": "Frankie and Max went trick-or-treating. Frankie got 74 pieces of candy. Max got 92 pieces of candy. How many more pieces of candy did Max get?", "qid": "950", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of candies Frankie got and the number of candies Max got.\n\n74 - 92 = -18\n\nSince the number of candies Max got is more than Frankie, we need to express this as a positive number. To do this, we can add 18 to the number of candies Frankie got.\n\n74 + 18 = 92\n\nThe answer is 92.", "answer": 18, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/950.png"}
