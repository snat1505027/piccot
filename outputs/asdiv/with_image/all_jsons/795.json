{"question": "The weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. The total weight of 3 such watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. How much heavier is a watermelon than a pineapple?", "qid": "795", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples separately.\n\n1. Weight of 3 watermelons:\nThe weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. To find the weight of 3 watermelons, we need to divide the weight by the number of watermelons.\n5 kg 200 g \u00f7 4 = 1.25 kg 50 g\n\n2. Weight of 4 pineapples:\nThe weight of 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. To find the weight of 3 pineapples, we need to divide the weight by the number of pineapples.\n5 kg 700 g \u00f7 4 = 1.25 kg 175 g\n\nNow, we can compare the weight of a watermelon and a pineapple.\n1.25 kg 50 g (weight of 3 watermelons) - 1.25 kg 175 g (weight of 3 pineapples) = 0.0 kg 325 g\n\nThe weight of a watermelon is 0.0 kg 325 g heavier than a pineapple.", "answer": 850, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/795.png"}
