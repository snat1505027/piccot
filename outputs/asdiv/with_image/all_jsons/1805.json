She wants each classroom to receive an identical set of campaign materials, without having any materials left over. What is the greatest number of classrooms Joanne can distribute materials to? ", "qid": "1805", "response": "To find the greatest number of classrooms Joanne can distribute materials to, we need to find the total number of campaign materials she has and divide it by the number of materials per set.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of campaign materials:\n20 flyers + 16 buttons = 36 campaign materials\n\nNext, we need to find the number of materials per set:\n36 campaign materials \u00f7 20 flyers + 16 buttons = 1.8 materials per set\n\nSince Joanne has 1.8 materials per set and wants to distribute an identical set to each classroom, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of classrooms.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of classrooms Joanne can distribute materials to is 2.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1805.png"}
