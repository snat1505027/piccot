{"question": "Paul made forty-four dollars mowing lawns and twenty-eight dollars weed eating. If he only spent nine dollar a week, how long would the money last him?", "qid": "1978", "response": "First, we need to find the total amount of money Paul made. We can do this by adding the amount he made from mowing lawns and weed eating: $44 + $28 = $<<44+28=72>>72.\nNext, we need to find the total amount of money Paul spent. We know he spent $9 a week, so we can multiply that by the number of weeks the money will last: $9 x time = $<<9*time=9*time>>9*time.\nFinally, we can find the time by dividing the total amount of money by the total amount of money spent: $72 \u00f7 $9 = $<<72/9=8>>8.\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1978.png"}
