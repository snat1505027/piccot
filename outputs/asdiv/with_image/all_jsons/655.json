{"question": "There are 2 green books, 1 blue book, and 4 orange books in a bookshelf. If 3 of them are taken out to be read, how many books are left on the bookshelf?", "qid": "655", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. The image shows a bookshelf with a total of 7 books. We are given that 3 books are taken out, so we need to find the number of books left on the bookshelf.\n\nFirst, we can represent the number of books on the bookshelf using the equation:\n\nNumber of books = Total number of books - Number of books taken out\n\nIn this case, the number of books taken out is 3. So, the equation becomes:\n\nNumber of books = 7 - 3\n\nNumber of books = 4\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/655.png"}
