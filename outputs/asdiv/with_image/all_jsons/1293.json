{"question": "A man travels 600 km partly by train and partly by car. If he covers 400 km by train and the rest by car, it takes him 6 hours and 30 minutes. But if he travels 200 km by train and rest by car, he takes 30 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and that of car.", "qid": "1293", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. The man travels 600 km, and he covers 400 km by train and the rest by car. It takes him 6 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nWe can use the following equation to find the speed of the train:\n\nDistance / Time = Speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 400 km, and the time is 6 hours and 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 6.5 hours.\n\n400 km / 6.5 hours = 60 km/h\n\nNow, we need to find the speed of the car. We know that the man travels 600 km in total, and he covers 200 km by train and the rest by car. If he travels 200 km by train and takes 30 minutes longer, it means that he travels 200 km by car and takes 30 minutes longer, which is equivalent to 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.\n\nSo, the distance the man travels by car is 600 km - 200 km = 400 km.\n\nWe can use the same equation to find the speed of the car:\n\nDistance / Time = Speed\n\n400 km / 60 minutes = 6.667 km/h\n\nThe answer is 60 km/h for the train and 6.667 km/h for the car.", "answer": 100, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1293.png"}
