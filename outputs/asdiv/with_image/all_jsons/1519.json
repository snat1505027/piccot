{"question": "A mailman has to give twenty-eight pieces of junk mail to each block. If there are four houses on a block, how many pieces of junk mail should he give each house?", "qid": "1519", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces of junk mail the mailman should give to each house on a block. We know that there are four houses on a block and that the mailman has to give twenty-eight pieces of junk mail to each block.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of pieces of junk mail the mailman should give to each house on a block. To do this, we can divide the number of pieces of junk mail the mailman has to give to each block by the number of houses on a block.\n\n28 pieces of junk mail per block \u00f7 4 houses per block = <<28/4=7>>7 pieces of junk mail per house.\n\nTherefore, the mailman should give seven pieces of junk mail to each house on a block.\n\nThe answer is 7 pieces of junk mail per house.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1519.png"}
