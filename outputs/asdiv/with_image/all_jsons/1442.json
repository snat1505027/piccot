{"question": "A farmer had 225 seeds to plant. He planted the same number of seeds each day and it took him 5 days to plant them all. How many seeds did he plant per day?", "qid": "1442", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of seeds the farmer planted per day. Let's start by using the information provided in the image.\n\n225 seeds to plant\n5 days to plant them all\n\nWe can set up a proportion to represent the number of seeds planted per day. Let's call the number of seeds planted per day 'x'.\n\n225 seeds to plant / 5 days to plant them all = x seeds planted per day\n\nNow, we can simplify the proportion by dividing both sides by 5.\n\n225 / 5 = x\n\nx = 45\n\nSo, the farmer planted 45 seeds per day.\n\nThe answer is 45.", "answer": 45, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1442.png"}
