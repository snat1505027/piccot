{"question": "Blithe has a lot of toys. He lost 6 of them and found 9 in his closet. If he had 43 after that, how many toys did Blithe have at first?", "qid": "661", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of toys Blithe had before he lost 6 of them. We can do this by using the information that he had 43 toys after losing 6 and finding 9.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of toys Blithe had after losing 6. We can do this by subtracting 6 from 43:\n\n43 - 6 = 37\n\nNext, we need to find the number of toys Blithe had before he lost 6. We can do this by adding the number of toys he found in his closet (9) to the number of toys he had after losing 6 (37):\n\n37 + 9 = 46\n\nThe answer is 46.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/661.png"}
