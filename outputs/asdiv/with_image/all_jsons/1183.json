{"question": "The ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack are consecutive odd numbers. The sum of the ages of Peter and Margaret equals Jack's age before 5 years. Find the ages of Peter, Margaret and Jack.", "qid": "1183", "response": "Let's start by analyzing the information given in the image. The ages of Peter, Margaret, and Jack are consecutive odd numbers. We know that the sum of Peter and Margaret's ages is equal to Jack's age before 5 years.\n\nLet's represent the ages as follows:\nPeter's age = x\nMargaret's age = x + 2\nJack's age before 5 years = x + 3\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the equation for the sum of Peter and Margaret's ages is:\nx + (x + 2) = x + 3\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n2x + 2 = 3x + 3\n\nSubtracting 2x from both sides, we get:\n2 = 3x - 3\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\nx = 2/3\n\nNow, we can find Margaret's age:\nMargaret's age = x + 2 = (2/3) + 2 = 2/3 + 2 = 4/3\n\nFinally, we can find Jack's age before 5 years:\nJack's age before 5 years = x + 3 = (2/3) + 3 = 2/3 + 3 = 5/3\n\nThe answer is:\nPeter's age = 2/3\nMargaret's age = 4/3\nJack's age before 5 years = 5/3", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1183.png"}
