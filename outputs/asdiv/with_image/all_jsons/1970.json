{"question": "John had 33 socks. If he threw away 19 old ones that didn't fit and bought 13 new ones, how many socks would he have?", "qid": "1970", "response": "First, we need to find the number of socks John has after throwing away 19 old ones. We can do this by subtracting 19 from 33:\n\n33 - 19 = 14\n\nNext, we need to find the number of socks John has after buying 13 new ones. We can do this by adding 13 to the number of socks he has after throwing away the old ones:\n\n14 + 13 = 27\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of socks John has now. We can do this by adding the number of socks he has after buying new ones to the number of socks he has after throwing away old ones:\n\n27 + 14 = 41\n\nThe answer is 41.", "answer": 27, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1970.png"}
