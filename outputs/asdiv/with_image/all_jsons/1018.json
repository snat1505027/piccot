{"question": "The ratio of the number correct answers to incorrect answers on Sam's math test is 7:3. The difference between correct and incorrect answers is 20. What was the total number of questions on the test?", "qid": "1018", "response": "Let's start by using the given information to create an equation. We know that the ratio of correct answers to incorrect answers is 7:3, so we can write:\n\n7x / 3x = 20\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 3x:\n\n7 / 3 = 20 / 3x\n\nNow, we can simplify further by multiplying both sides by 3x:\n\n7x = 20\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 7:\n\nx = 20 / 7\n\nx = 2.857\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a number, we can round this value to the nearest whole number, which is 3.\n\nThe total number of questions on the test is 3.\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 50, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1018.png"}
