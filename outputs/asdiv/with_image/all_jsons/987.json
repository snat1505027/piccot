The pattern is that the number of power drills ordered increases by 3 each month.\n\nIn January, the store ordered 5 power drills.\nIn February, the store ordered 6 power drills, which is 3 more than January.\nIn March, the store ordered 8 power drills, which is 3 more than February.\nIn April, the store ordered 11 power drills, which is 3 more than March.\n\nTo find the number of power drills ordered in May, we need to add 3 more to the number of power drills ordered in April.\n\n5 + 6 + 8 + 11 = 30\n\nThe answer is 30.", "answer": 15, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/987.png"}
