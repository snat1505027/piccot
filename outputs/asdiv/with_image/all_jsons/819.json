{"question": "Maddie, Luisa, and Amy counted their books. Maddie had 15 books. Luisa had 18 books. Together, Amy and Luisa had 9 more books than Maddie. How many books did Amy have?", "qid": "819", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of books that Maddie and Luisa have together. We can do this by adding the number of books Maddie has (15) and the number of books Luisa has (18).\n\n15 + 18 = 33\n\nNow, we need to find out how many books Amy and Luisa have together. We know that they have 9 more books than Maddie, so we can add 9 to the total number of books Maddie and Luisa have.\n\n33 + 9 = 42\n\nSince the problem states that Amy and Luisa have 9 more books than Maddie, we can conclude that Amy has 42 - 15 = 27 books.\n\nThe answer is 27.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/819.png"}
