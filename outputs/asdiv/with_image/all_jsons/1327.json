{"question": "Of 240 stamps that Harry and his sister collected, Harry collected 3 times as many as his sisters. How many did each collect?", "qid": "1327", "response": "Let's start by finding the number of stamps Harry's sister collected. We know that Harry collected 3 times as many as his sister, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nHarry's stamps = 3 x Sister's stamps\n\nSince we know the total number of stamps collected by both Harry and his sister is 240, we can set up another equation:\n\n240 = Harry's stamps + Sister's stamps\n\nNow we can solve the system of equations. First, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:\n\n240 = 3x + x\n\nThen, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n240 / 3 = x + x / 3\n\nx = 240 / 3 - 2x / 3\n\nx = 80 - 2x\n\nx = 80 - 2x\n\nNow, we can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n\n2x = 80 - x\n\n2x = 80 - 80 + x\n\n2x = 0 + x\n\nx = x\n\nThis equation is true by definition, as x represents the number of stamps collected by Harry's sister.\n\nNow that we have the number of stamps collected by Harry's sister, we can find the number of stamps Harry collected by using the first equation:\n\nHarry's stamps = 3 x Sister's stamps\n\nHarry's stamps = 3 x 80\n\nHarry's stamps = 240\n\nSince the total number of stamps collected is 240, we can conclude that each person collected 120 stamps.\n\nThe answer is 120.", "answer": 60, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1327.png"}
