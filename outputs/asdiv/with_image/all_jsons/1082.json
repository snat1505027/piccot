{"question": "Kiera is making trail mix out of 16 bags of nuts and 6 bags of dried fruit. She wants each new portion of trail mix to be identical, containing the same combination of bags of nuts and bags of dried fruit, with no bags left over. What is the greatest number of portions of trail mix Kiera can make?", "qid": "1082", "response": "To find the greatest number of portions of trail mix Kiera can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 16 and 6.\n\n16 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2\n6 = 2 x 3\n\nThe prime factors of 16 are 2 and 8, while the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The common prime factors are 2.\n\nTo find the GCD, we multiply the common prime factors:\n\nGCD = 2 x 2 = 4\n\nSince Kiera has 4 bags of nuts and 4 bags of dried fruit, she can make 4 portions of trail mix.\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1082.png"}
