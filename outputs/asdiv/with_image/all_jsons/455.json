{"question": "Haley loves to collect things. This year, she decided to give away part of her collection as it was taking too much space in her room. Nine of her closest friends like stickers. If she plans to give all of them an equal number of stickers, how many will each receive if she has 72 stickers?", "qid": "455", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of stickers each friend will receive if Haley gives away an equal number of stickers to all nine friends.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of stickers Haley has. The image shows that Haley has 72 stickers.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of stickers each friend will receive. Since there are nine friends, we can divide the total number of stickers by nine to find the number of stickers each friend will receive.\n\n72 stickers \u00f7 9 friends = <<72/9=8>>8 stickers per friend\n\nTherefore, each of Haley's nine friends will receive 8 stickers.\n\nThe answer is 8 stickers per friend.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/455.png"}
