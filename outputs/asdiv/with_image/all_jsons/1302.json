{"question": "A person invested some amount at 12% simple interest and some amount at 10% simple interest. He received an annual interest of $130. But, if he had interchanged and invested he would have received $4 more. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?", "qid": "1302", "response": "Let's denote the amount invested at 12% as A12 and the amount invested at 10% as A10.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the amount invested at 12% is equal to the amount invested at 10% multiplied by 1.12.\n\nA12 = A10 \\* 1.12\n\nWe also know that the total annual interest received is $130. So, we can calculate the annual interest received at each rate:\n\nA12 \\* 0.12 = $130\nA10 \\* 0.12 = $130\n\nNow, we can solve for A10:\n\nA10 = $130 / 0.12\nA10 = $1083.33\n\nWe can now find the amount invested at 10% by multiplying the annual interest by the number of periods (1 year):\n\nA10 = $1083.33 \\* 1\nA10 = $1083.33\n\nSince we know that A12 = A10 \\* 1.12, we can find the amount invested at 12%:\n\nA12 = A10 \\* 1.12\nA12 = $1083.33 \\* 1.12\nA12 = $1191.96\n\nThe answer is $1083.33 and $1191.96.", "answer": 500, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1302.png"}
