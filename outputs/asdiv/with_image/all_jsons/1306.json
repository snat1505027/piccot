{"question": "In a 2-digit number, the tens digit is 4 times the units digit. When the digits are reversed, the new number formed is 54 less than the original number. Find the original number.", "qid": "1306", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. Let's start by identifying the original number.\n\n1. The tens digit is 4 times the units digit. Let's call the tens digit \"x\" and the units digit \"y\". So, we have x = 4y.\n2. When the digits are reversed, the new number formed is 54 less than the original number. Let's call the reversed number \"z\". So, we have z = original number - 54.\n3. We know that the tens digit of the reversed number is the same as the units digit of the original number. Therefore, we can write z = x - 54.\n4. Now, we can substitute the values of x and y from step 1 into the equation for z:\nz = 4y - 54\n\nSince we are looking for the original number, we can rearrange the equation to solve for y:\ny = (4/x)z + 54\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of z from step 3:\ny = (4/x)(x - 54) + 54\n\nSimplify the equation:\ny = x - 54\n\nWe know that the tens digit is 4 times the units digit, so we can write x = 4y. Substitute this into the equation:\nx = 4(x - 54)\n\nSimplify the equation:\nx = 4x - 216\n\nAdd 216 to both sides of the equation:\nx = 4x + 216\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx = (4x + 216) / 4\n\nSimplify the equation:\nx = x + 54\n\nSince we are looking for the original number, we can rearrange the equation to solve for x:\nx = (x + 54)/4\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x from step 6 into the equation for y:\ny = (x + 54)/4\n\nSimplify the equation:\ny = (x + 54)/4\n\nWe have now found the original number. The answer is x = 54 and y =", "answer": 82, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1306.png"}
