{"question": "The teacher gave 42 pencils to 12 students equally. How many pencils did each student get?", "qid": "746", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pencils each student received. First, we need to find the total number of pencils the teacher gave to the students. We can do this by multiplying the number of students by the number of pencils each student received.\n\nThe teacher gave 42 pencils to 12 students. To find the number of pencils each student received, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of students:\n\n42 pencils \u00f7 12 students = 3.5 pencils per student\n\nSince we cannot give a fraction of a pencil, we need to round the number of pencils each student received to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round 3.5 to 4 pencils per student.\n\nTherefore, each student received 4 pencils.\n\nThe answer is 4 pencils.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/746.png"}
