{"question": "Jovana had 5 pounds of shells in her bucket. She added some shells and now has 28 pounds of shells. How many pounds did she add?", "qid": "93", "response": "Jovana had 5 pounds of shells in her bucket. She added some shells and now has 28 pounds of shells. To find out how many pounds she added, we need to subtract the initial weight from the current weight.\n\n5 pounds - 28 pounds = -23 pounds\n\nSince the result is negative, it means that Jovana removed shells from her bucket, not added them. The answer is -23 pounds.", "answer": 23, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/93.png"}
