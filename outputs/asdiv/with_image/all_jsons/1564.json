{"question": "A delivery driver had to make three more stops on his route. At each stop he had to drop off nine boxes. How many boxes does he have?", "qid": "1564", "response": "The image shows a table with the number of stops and the number of boxes per stop. The table has three rows, and the number of boxes per stop increases by one for each row.\n\nThe first row shows that the driver has to make three stops, and at each stop, he has to drop off nine boxes.\nThe second row shows that the driver has to make three more stops, and at each stop, he has to drop off ten boxes.\nThe third row shows that the driver has to make three more stops, and at each stop, he has to drop off eleven boxes.\n\nTo find the total number of boxes, we need to add the number of boxes for each stop across all three rows.\n\nThe first row has 3 stops \\* 9 boxes per stop = 27 boxes.\nThe second row has 3 stops \\* 10 boxes per stop = 30 boxes.\nThe third row has 3 stops \\* 11 boxes per stop = 33 boxes.\n\nAdding the total number of boxes from all three rows, we get:\n27 + 30 + 33 = 90 boxes.\n\nThe answer is 90 boxes.", "answer": 27, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1564.png"}
