{"question": "Monroe Vitamin Shop sold equal quantities of Vitamin A and Vitamin D supplements this morning, even though the Vitamin A supplements come in packs of 7 and the Vitamin D supplements in packs of 17. What is the smallest number of each type that the store could have sold?", "qid": "1096", "response": "To find the smallest number of each type that the store could have sold, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 17. The LCM of 7 and 17 is 119.\n\nSince the store sold equal quantities of both Vitamin A and Vitamin D supplements, we can find the smallest number of each type by dividing the total quantity of supplements sold by the LCM.\n\nThe total quantity of supplements sold is the product of the quantities of each type: 7 x 17 = 119.\n\nTo find the smallest number of each type, we can divide the total quantity by the LCM: 119 \u00f7 119 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of each type that the store could have sold is 1 pack of Vitamin A supplements and 1 pack of Vitamin D supplements.\n\nThe answer is 1 pack of Vitamin A supplements and 1 pack of Vitamin D supplements.", "answer": 119, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1096.png"}
