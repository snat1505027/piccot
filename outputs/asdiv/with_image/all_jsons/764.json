{"question": "15 students split 122 portfolios of paintings. Each student should get the same number of portfolios. How many portfolios of paintings will each of them get?", "qid": "764", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of portfolios of paintings each student should get. First, we need to find the total number of portfolios of paintings. We can do this by multiplying the number of students by the number of portfolios each student should get.\n\n15 students \\* x portfolios per student = 122 portfolios of paintings\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can divide the total number of portfolios by the number of students.\n\n122 portfolios of paintings \u00f7 15 students = x\n\nx = 8.133333333333333\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a portfolio, we need to round the value of x to the nearest whole number.\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, each student should get 8 portfolios of paintings.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/764.png"}
