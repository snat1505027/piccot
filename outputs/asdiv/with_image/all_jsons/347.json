{"question": "Next on her list are the homeless people where she spent a total of $900.00. If she gave $325.00 to the first set of homeless families and $260.00 to the second set of families, how much did she give to the last set of homeless families?", "qid": "347", "response": "The total amount spent on homeless people is $900.00. She gave $325.00 to the first set of families and $260.00 to the second set of families. To find the amount given to the last set of families, we need to subtract the amounts given to the first two sets from the total amount spent.\n\n$900.00 - $325.00 - $260.00 = $<<900-325-260=325>>325.00\n\nThe answer is $325.00.", "answer": 315, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/347.png"}
