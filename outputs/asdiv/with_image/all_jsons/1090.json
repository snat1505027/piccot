{"question": "Veronica is making emergency-preparedness kits to share with friends. She has 20 bottles of water and 12 cans of food, which she would like to distribute equally among the kits, with nothing left over. What is the greatest number of kits Veronica can make?", "qid": "1090", "response": "To find the greatest number of kits Veronica can make, we need to distribute the 20 bottles of water and 12 cans of food equally among the kits.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of items Veronica has:\n\n20 bottles of water + 12 cans of food = 32 items\n\nNext, we need to find the average number of items per kit:\n\n32 items / x kits = average number of items per kit\n\nSince we want to distribute the items evenly, we can set up an equation:\n\nx kits \\* average number of items per kit = 32 items\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\nx kits \\* average number of items per kit = 32 items\nx kits = 32 / average number of items per kit\n\nTo find the average number of items per kit, we can divide the total number of items by the number of kits:\n\naverage number of items per kit = 32 items / x kits\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for average number of items per kit into the equation for x kits:\n\nx kits = 32 / (32 / x kits)\n\nx kits = 32 / x kits\n\nx kits = 32\n\nSo, the greatest number of kits Veronica can make is 32.\n\nThe answer is 32.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1090.png"}
