The smallest common multiple of 2 and 9 is 18.\n\nAmanda's band plays songs in sets of 2, so the smallest number of songs they could have performed is 18 divided by 2, which is 9.\n\nSadie's band plays songs in sets of 9, so the smallest number of songs they could have performed is 18 divided by 9, which is 2.\n\nThe answer is 9 for Amanda's band and 2 for Sadie's band.", "answer": 18, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1097.png"}
