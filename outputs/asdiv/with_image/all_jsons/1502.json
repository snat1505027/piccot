{"question": "A student finished 45 of her homework problems in class. If the ratio of problems she finished to problems she still had left was 9:4, how many homework problems did she have total?", "qid": "1502", "response": "Let's denote the total number of homework problems as x.\n\nFrom the image, we know that the student finished 45 problems, so the number of problems she still has left is x - 45.\n\nThe ratio of problems finished to problems left is 9:4, which means that for every 9 problems finished, there are 4 problems left.\n\nWe can represent this as a fraction: 9/4.\n\nTo find the total number of problems, we need to find the common denominator for both 9 and 4, which is 36.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the fraction as 9/4 = 36/x, where x is the total number of problems.\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by x and simplifying:\n\n36/x \\* x = 9\n\n36x = 9x\n\n36 = 9\n\nThis is a contradiction, as 36 is not equal to 9.\n\nTherefore, the image does not provide enough information to solve the problem. The answer is unknown.", "answer": 65, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1502.png"}
