{"question": "Martin is pasting pieces of square colored paper of equal size onto a board measuring 72 cm by 90 cm. If only whole square pieces are used, and the board is to be completely covered, what is the largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper?", "qid": "1870", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper that can be used to cover the entire board.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the board. The board measures 72 cm by 90 cm, so its area is:\n\n72 cm x 90 cm = 6544 square centimeters\n\nNext, we need to find the smallest possible side length of a square that can cover the entire board. To do this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the hypotenuse is the length of the board (72 cm), and the other two sides are the length and width of the square colored paper. Let's assume the length of the square colored paper is x cm, and the width is y cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 72^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 504\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest possible values of x and y that satisfy this equation. We can start by solving for x:\n\nx = \u221a(504 - y^2)\n\nNext, we can substitute this expression for x into the original equation:\n\ny^2 + (\u221a(504 - y^2))^2 = 504\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny^2 + (504 - y^2) = 504\n\ny^2 = 504 - y^2\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = \u00b1\u221a(504 - y^2)\n\nSince y is a positive number, we can discard the negative solution. Therefore, the smallest possible value of y is:\n\ny = \u221a(504 - y^2) = \u221a504 = 24 cm\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can find the smallest possible value of x:\n\nx", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1870.png"}
