We know that the area of the garden is 1800 square feet and the height is 40 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:\n\nArea = width x height\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to find the width:\n\nwidth = area / height\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nwidth = 1800 / 40\n\nwidth = 45\n\nThe answer is 45 feet.", "answer": 45, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1209.png"}
