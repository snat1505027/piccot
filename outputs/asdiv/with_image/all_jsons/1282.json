{"question": "A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.", "qid": "1282", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. The image shows a number line with the number 4 and the word \"sum\" written above it. This suggests that the number is four times the sum of its digits. Additionally, the word \"product\" is written below the number, indicating that the number is twice the product of its digits.\n\nLet's start by finding the sum of the digits. Since the number is two digits, we can assume that the digits are either 1 and 2 or 2 and 1. Let's consider both cases:\n\n1. If the digits are 1 and 2, the sum of the digits is 3.\n2. If the digits are 2 and 1, the sum of the digits is 3.\n\nNow, we know that the number is four times the sum of its digits. Therefore, the number must be 4 \\* 3 = 12.\n\nNext, we need to find the product of the digits. For 1 and 2, the product is 2. For 2 and 1, the product is 2.\n\nSince the number is twice the product of its digits, we can conclude that the number is either 12 or 2 \\* 2 = 4.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively determine the number from the given information. The answer could be either 12 or 4.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1282.png"}
