{"question": "The weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg. The total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. How much heavier is a double bed than a single bed?", "qid": "792", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight difference between a single bed and a double bed.\n\nFirst, we can find the weight of a single bed by dividing the total weight of 5 single beds by 5:\n50 kg \u00f7 5 = 10 kg per single bed\n\nNext, we can find the weight of a double bed by dividing the total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds by 6 (2 single beds + 4 double beds):\n100 kg \u00f7 6 = 16.67 kg per double bed\n\nNow, we can find the weight difference between a single bed and a double bed by subtracting the weight of a single bed from the weight of a double bed:\n16.67 kg - 10 kg = 6.67 kg\n\nThe answer is 6.67 kg.", "answer": 10, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/792.png"}
