{"question": "A fast food restaurant had ninety-nine hotdogs. After selling some they had ninety-seven left. How many hotdogs did they sell? ", "qid": "1717", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of hotdogs that were sold. We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\nFirst, we know that the restaurant had ninety-nine hotdogs initially. After selling some, they had ninety-seven hotdogs left.\n\nNext, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\nHotdogs initially - Hotdogs sold = Hotdogs left\n\nIn this case, the equation would be:\n\n99 - x = 97\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation to find the number of hotdogs sold (x). To do this, we can add 97 to both sides of the equation:\n\n99 + 97 = x\n\n196 = x\n\nFinally, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n98.5 = x/2\n\nThe answer is 98.5.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1717.png"}
