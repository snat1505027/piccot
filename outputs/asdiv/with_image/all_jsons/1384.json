{"question": "A librarian had to pack five hundred ninety books into boxes. If each box can hold three books, how many boxes did she need?", "qid": "1384", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes needed to hold 590 books, assuming each box can hold three books.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of books that can fit in one box. To do this, we can divide the number of books by the number of books per box:\n\n590 books \u00f7 3 books per box = 196.67 boxes\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of boxes. In this case, we need 200 boxes.\n\nThe answer is 200 boxes.", "answer": 197, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1384.png"}
