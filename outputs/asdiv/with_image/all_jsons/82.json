{"question": "Isabella's hair is 18 cubes long. If her hair grows 4 more inches, how long will it be?", "qid": "82", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many inches Isabella's hair will be after it grows 4 more inches. First, we need to convert 18 cubes to inches. Since we don't know the size of a cube, we cannot directly convert it to inches. However, we can use the fact that 1 inch is equal to 12 cubes.\n\n18 cubes = 18/12 inches = 1.5 inches\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more inches Isabella's hair will be after it grows 4 more inches.\n\n1.5 inches + 4 inches = 5.5 inches\n\nThe answer is 5.5 inches.", "answer": 22, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/82.png"}
