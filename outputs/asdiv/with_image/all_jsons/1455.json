{"question": "Rachel bought some wrapping paper for Christmas that was 4 feet long and with an area of 20 square feet. What is the width of the wrapping paper?", "qid": "1455", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the wrapping paper. We can use the given information that the wrapping paper is 4 feet long and has an area of 20 square feet.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: area = length x width. Since we know the length is 48 inches, we can set up the equation:\n\n20 = width x 48\n\nNow, we need to solve for the width. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 48:\n\n20 / 48 = width / 48\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0.42 = width / 48\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 48 to get the width in inches:\n\n0.42 x 48 = width x 48\n\n43.2 = width\n\nThe width of the wrapping paper is 43.2 inches.\n\nThe answer is 43.2 inches.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1455.png"}
