{"question": "An airline has 41 pieces of luggage to put away. If each luggage compartment will hold 5 pieces of luggage, how many will be in the compartment that isn't full?", "qid": "1111", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of luggage compartments that will hold 41 pieces of luggage.\n\nFirst, we can find the number of compartments by dividing the total number of pieces of luggage by the number of pieces each compartment can hold:\n\n41 pieces of luggage \u00f7 5 pieces per compartment = 8.2 compartments\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a compartment, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of compartments. In this case, we will have 9 compartments.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of pieces of luggage that will fit in the compartment that isn't full. To do this, we can subtract the number of pieces of luggage in the other compartments from the total number of pieces of luggage:\n\n41 pieces of luggage - (8 compartments x 5 pieces per compartment) = 41 - 40 = 1 piece of luggage\n\nThe answer is 1 piece of luggage.", "answer": 1, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1111.png"}
