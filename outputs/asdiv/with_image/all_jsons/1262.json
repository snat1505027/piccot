{"question": "After 15 years, Ariel will be four times as old as she is now. Determine her present age.", "qid": "1262", "response": "Let's start by using the equation provided in the image:\n\nAriel's present age = 4 \u00d7 Ariel's age after 15 years\n\nWe know that after 15 years, Ariel will be four times as old as she is now. So, we can write:\n\nAriel's age after 15 years = 4 \u00d7 Ariel's present age\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for Ariel's present age:\n\nAriel's present age = Ariel's age after 15 years \u00f7 4\n\nNow, we can substitute the equation for Ariel's age after 15 years:\n\nAriel's present age = (4 \u00d7 Ariel's present age) \u00f7 4\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 4:\n\nAriel's present age = Ariel's present age \u00f7 4\n\nThis equation is true by definition, as Ariel's present age is equal to her age after 15 years divided by 4.\n\nThe answer is Ariel's present age = Ariel's age after 15 years \u00f7 4.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1262.png"}
