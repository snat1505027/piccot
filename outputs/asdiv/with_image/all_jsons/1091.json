{"question": "Colton has 16 blue marbles and 8 white ones. If he wants to place them in identical groups without any marbles left over, what is the greatest number of groups Colton can make?", "qid": "1091", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest number of groups Colton can make without leaving any marbles over. We can do this by dividing the total number of marbles by the number of marbles in each group.\n\nTotal marbles: 16 blue + 8 white = 24 marbles\n\nNumber of marbles in each group: 24 \u00f7 2 = 12\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up the number of marbles in each group to the nearest whole number.\n\nNumber of marbles in each group: 12 \u00f7 1 = 12\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest number of groups that can be made with 24 marbles. We can do this by dividing the total number of marbles by the number of marbles in each group.\n\nTotal marbles: 24 \u00f7 12 = 2\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up the number of groups to the nearest whole number.\n\nNumber of groups: 2 \u00f7 1 = 2\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1091.png"}
