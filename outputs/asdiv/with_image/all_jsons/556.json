{"question": "I have 80 cents to buy candy. If each gumdrop costs 4 cents, how many gumdrops can I buy?", "qid": "556", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many gumdrops we can buy with 80 cents.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many cents are in 80 cents. We can do this by dividing 80 by 100.\n\n80 \u00f7 100 = 0.8\n\nNext, we need to find out how many gumdrops we can buy with 0.8 cents. We know that each gumdrop costs 4 cents, so we can find the number of gumdrops by dividing 0.8 by 4.\n\n0.8 \u00f7 4 = 0.2\n\nSince we cannot buy a fraction of a gumdrop, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of gumdrops.\n\nTherefore, we can buy 2 gumdrops with 80 cents.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 20, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/556.png"}
