{"question": "Zayed is helping his classmates get ready for their math test by making them identical packages of pencils and calculators. He has 72 pencils and 24 calculators and he must use all of the pencils and calculators. If Zayed creates the greatest number of identical packages possible, how many pencils will be in each package?", "qid": "1832", "response": "To find the greatest number of identical packages possible, we need to use all the pencils and calculators. We can start by dividing the pencils into packages. Since we have 72 pencils and we want to create the greatest number of packages, we can divide them by 24, which is the number of calculators.\n\n72 pencils \u00f7 24 calculators = 3 packages of pencils\n\nNow, we have 3 packages of pencils, and we need to find the greatest number of packages of calculators. To do this, we can divide the 24 calculators by 3, the number of packages of pencils.\n\n24 calculators \u00f7 3 packages of pencils = 8 packages of calculators\n\nSo, the greatest number of identical packages possible is 3 packages of pencils and 8 packages of calculators.\n\nThe answer is 3 packages of pencils and 8 packages of calculators.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1832.png"}
