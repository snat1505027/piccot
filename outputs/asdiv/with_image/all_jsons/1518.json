{"question": "At an ice cream shop the ratio of sugar cones sold to waffle cones sold is 5:4. If there are 45 sugar cones sold, how many waffles cones would be sold?", "qid": "1518", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of waffle cones sold based on the given ratio.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of waffle cones sold. We know that the ratio of sugar cones to waffle cones is 5:4.\n2. Next, we can use the ratio to find the number of waffle cones sold. Since there are 45 sugar cones sold, we can multiply the number of sugar cones by the ratio of waffle cones to sugar cones (45 x 4/5).\n3. The result of the multiplication is 60. Therefore, there are 60 waffle cones sold.\n\nThe answer is 60.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1518.png"}
