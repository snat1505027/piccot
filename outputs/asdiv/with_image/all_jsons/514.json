{"question": "At the zoo, I see 35 elephants and 48 tigers. How many legs do I see?", "qid": "514", "response": "To find the total number of legs, we need to add the number of legs of the elephants and the tigers.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of legs per elephant and per tiger.\n\nThe image shows that there are 35 elephants and 48 tigers.\n\nTo find the number of legs per elephant, we can divide the total number of elephants by the number of elephants in the image.\n\n35 elephants / 35 elephants = 1\n\nTo find the number of legs per tiger, we can divide the total number of tigers by the number of tigers in the image.\n\n48 tigers / 48 tigers = 1\n\nNow that we have the number of legs per elephant and per tiger, we can multiply the number of elephants and tigers to find the total number of legs.\n\n1 (legs per elephant) \\* 35 (elephants) = 35 legs\n\n1 (legs per tiger) \\* 48 (tigers) = 48 legs\n\nAdding the total number of legs from both elephants and tigers, we get:\n\n35 legs + 48 legs = 83 legs\n\nThe answer is 83.", "answer": 332, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/514.png"}
