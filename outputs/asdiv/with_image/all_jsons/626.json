{"question": "Jae bought 12 cartons of ice cream and 3 cartons of yogurt. Each carton of ice cream cost $9 and each carton of yogurt cost $2. How much more did Jae spend on ice cream than on yogurt?", "qid": "626", "response": "First, we need to find the total cost of ice cream and yogurt.\n\nTotal cost of ice cream = 12 cartons x $9 per carton = $<<12*9=108>>108\n\nTotal cost of yogurt = 3 cartons x $2 per carton = $<<3*2=6>>6\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount spent by Jae.\n\nTotal amount spent = Total cost of ice cream + Total cost of yogurt = $108 + $6 = $<<108+6=114>>114\n\nFinally, we need to find the difference between the total cost of ice cream and the total cost of yogurt.\n\nDifference = Total cost of ice cream - Total cost of yogurt = $108 - $6 = $<<108-6=102>>102\n\nThe answer is $102.", "answer": 102, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/626.png"}
