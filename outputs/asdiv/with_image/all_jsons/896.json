{"question": "The sum of two numbers is 62. One of the numbers is 27. What is the other number?", "qid": "896", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the other number that, when added to 27, gives us 62. Let's start by using the information we have:\n\n1. The sum of two numbers is 62.\n2. One of the numbers is 27.\n\nWe can start by writing the equation for the sum of two numbers:\n\nx + y = 62\n\nSince we know one of the numbers is 27, we can substitute that value into the equation:\n\n27 + y = 62\n\nNow, we need to solve for y. To do this, we can subtract 27 from both sides of the equation:\n\ny = 62 - 27\n\ny = 35\n\nThe other number is 35.\n\nThe answer is 35.", "answer": 35, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/896.png"}
