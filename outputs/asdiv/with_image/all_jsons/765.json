{"question": "15 students split 122 portfolios of paintings. Each student should get the same number of portfolios. How many portfolios of paintings will be left?", "qid": "765", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of portfolios of paintings that can be divided equally among 15 students. We can do this by dividing the total number of portfolios by the number of students.\n\n122 portfolios \u00f7 15 students = 8 portfolios per student\n\nSince we cannot divide the total number of portfolios by the number of students without a remainder, we need to add one to the quotient to get the correct number of portfolios per student.\n\n8 portfolios + 1 = 9 portfolios per student\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of portfolios that will be left after each student receives their share. To do this, we can multiply the number of portfolios per student by the total number of students.\n\n9 portfolios/student \u00d7 15 students = 135 portfolios left\n\nThe answer is 135.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/765.png"}
