{"question": "The sum of three consecutive even numbers is 42. Choose suitable variable and create single variable algebraic equations and find the difference between the greatest and smallest number.", "qid": "1197", "response": "Let the three consecutive even numbers be x, x+2, and x+4.\n\nThe sum of these numbers is 42, so we can write the equation:\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 42\n\nTo find the difference between the greatest and smallest number, we need to find the difference between x and x + 4. We can do this by subtracting x from x + 4:\nx + 4 - x = 4\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1197.png"}
