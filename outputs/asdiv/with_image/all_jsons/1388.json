{"question": "There are five hundred fifty-four students going to a trivia competition. If each school van can hold nine students, how many vans will they need?", "qid": "1388", "response": "To find the number of vans needed, we need to divide the number of students by the number of students per van.\n\n554 students / 9 students per van = 61.55 vans\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a van, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of vans.\n\n61.55 vans rounded up to the nearest whole number = 62 vans\n\nThe answer is 62 vans.", "answer": 62, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1388.png"}
