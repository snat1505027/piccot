{"question": "Ms. Baker has 17 cupcakes. She wants to share them equally among her 3 children so that no one gets more than anyone else. If she gives each child as many cupcakes as possible, how many cupcakes will be left over for Ms. Baker to eat?", "qid": "640", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to divide the number of cupcakes by the number of children.\n\n17 cupcakes \u00f7 3 children = 5.67 cupcakes per child\n\nSince we cannot divide a whole number by a fraction, we need to round up the number of cupcakes per child to the nearest whole number.\n\n5.67 cupcakes per child \u2248 6 cupcakes per child\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of cupcakes that will be left over for Ms. Baker to eat:\n\n17 cupcakes - (3 children \u00d7 6 cupcakes per child) = 17 cupcakes - 18 cupcakes = -1 cupcake\n\nThe answer is -1 cupcake.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/640.png"}
