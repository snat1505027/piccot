{"question": "Janice has 316 bottle caps that must be put away in boxes. Douglas comes to help and brings 17 cookies to share with Janice. If there are 79 boxes, how many bottle caps must go in each box?", "qid": "2092", "response": "First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Janice has. We know that she has 316 bottle caps.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many bottle caps Douglas brought. We know that Douglas brought 17 cookies to share with Janice. Since there are 316 bottle caps and 17 cookies, we can find out the number of bottle caps Douglas brought by dividing the number of bottle caps by the number of cookies:\n\n316 bottle caps \u00f7 17 cookies = 18.529411764705882\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bottle cap, we need to round the number of bottle caps Douglas brought to the nearest whole number. We can do this by rounding up to the nearest whole number:\n\n18.529411764705882 \u2248 19 bottle caps\n\nNow that we know Janice has 316 bottle caps and Douglas brought 19 bottle caps, we can find out how many bottle caps must go in each box. We can do this by dividing the total number of bottle caps by the number of boxes:\n\n316 bottle caps \u00f7 79 boxes = 4.082608686768111\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bottle cap, we need to round the number of bottle caps per box to the nearest whole number:\n\n4.082608686768111 \u2248 4 bottle caps\n\nThe answer is 4 bottle caps per box.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2092.png"}
