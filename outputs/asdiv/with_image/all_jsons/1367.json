{"question": "Each side of a square newspaper ad is 8 centimeters long. What is the newspaper ad's perimeter?", "qid": "1367", "response": "To find the perimeter of the square newspaper ad, we need to use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length of a side, and W is the width of a side. In this case, L = 8 cm and W = 8 cm.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the diagonal of the square. The diagonal of a square is the distance from one corner to the opposite corner. We can find the diagonal by using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDiagonal = \u221a(L^2 + W^2) = \u221a(8^2 + 8^2) = \u221a64 = 8 cm\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter by adding the length of the diagonal to the sum of the lengths of the sides:\n\nP = 2L + 2W = 2(8 cm) + 2(8 cm) = 16 cm + 16 cm = 32 cm\n\nThe answer is 32 cm.", "answer": 32, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1367.png"}
