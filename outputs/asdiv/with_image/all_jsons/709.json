{"question": "The total weight of Jack and Sam is 96 pounds. If Jack weighs 52 pounds, how much heavier is Jack than Sam?", "qid": "709", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of Sam. We know that the total weight of Jack and Sam is 96 pounds, and Jack weighs 52 pounds. We can set up the following equation:\n\nWeight of Jack + Weight of Sam = Total weight\n\n52 + Weight of Sam = 96\n\nNow, we need to solve for the weight of Sam. To do this, we can subtract 52 from 96:\n\nWeight of Sam = 96 - 52\n\nWeight of Sam = 44\n\nSo, Jack is 52 pounds heavier than Sam. The answer is 52 pounds.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/709.png"}
