{"question": "Sum of a number and 15 is 96. Find the number.", "qid": "1189", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number that, when added to 15, results in 96. Let's start by using the equation:\n\nNumber + 15 = 96\n\nNext, we can simplify the equation by subtracting 15 from both sides:\n\nNumber = 96 - 15\n\nNow, we can simplify further by dividing both sides by 9:\n\nNumber = (96 - 15) / 9\n\nNumber = 9\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 81, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1189.png"}
