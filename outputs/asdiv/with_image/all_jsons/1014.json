{"question": "Gina mixed paint to make her favorite shade of purple. She filled up one third of the container with red paint. Then she filled the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?", "qid": "1014", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of paint Gina mixed. We know that she filled one third of the container with red paint, so we can find the amount of red paint by multiplying the container capacity by the fraction of the container filled with red paint.\n\n1000 ml \u00f7 3 = 333.33 ml\n\nNext, we need to find the amount of blue paint Gina mixed. We know that she filled the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint, so we can find the amount of blue paint by subtracting the amount of red paint from the container capacity.\n\n1000 ml - 333.33 ml = 666.67 ml\n\nNow we have the amount of red paint and the amount of blue paint. To find the total amount of paint Gina mixed, we need to add the two amounts together.\n\n333.33 ml + 666.67 ml = 1000 ml\n\nThe answer is 1000 ml.", "answer": 6000, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1014.png"}
