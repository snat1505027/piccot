{"question": "There are 32 forwards and 80 guards in Leo's basketball league. Leo must include all players on a team and wants each team to have the same number of forwards and the same number of guards. If Leo creates the greatest number of teams possible, how many guards will be on each team?", "qid": "1835", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of guards that can be distributed evenly among the teams. First, we need to find the total number of guards in the league.\n\nThere are 32 forwards and 80 guards in the league.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of teams that can be created with the given number of forwards and guards. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of teams = (total number of forwards + total number of guards) / (number of forwards per team + number of guards per team)\n\nIn this case, the formula would be:\n\nNumber of teams = (32 + 80) / (32 + x)\n\nWe don't know the number of guards per team yet, so we'll leave it as 'x' for now.\n\nNow, we can solve the equation:\n\nNumber of teams = (112) / (32 + x)\n\nTo find the number of guards per team, we can divide the total number of guards by the number of teams:\n\nNumber of guards per team = 80 / Number of teams\n\nWe still don't know the number of teams, so we can't find the exact number of guards per team. However, we can find the maximum number of teams possible by using the formula:\n\nNumber of teams = (total number of forwards + total number of guards) / (number of forwards per team + number of guards per team)\n\nIn this case, the formula would be:\n\nNumber of teams = (32 + 80) / (32 + x)\n\nWe can find the maximum number of teams by solving the equation for 'x':\n\nx = (32 + 80) / Number of teams\n\nTo find the maximum number of teams, we can plug in the maximum possible value for 'x':\n\nNumber of teams = (32 + 80) / (32 + 80) / Number of teams\n\nNumber of teams = 112 / 162 / Number of teams\n\nNumber of teams = 112 / 162\n\nNumber of teams = 0.69\n\nThis means that the maximum number of teams", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1835.png"}
