{"question": "Arthur baked 35 muffins. How many more muffins does Arthur have to bake to have 83 muffins?", "qid": "565", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many muffins Arthur needs to bake to reach 83 muffins. We can do this by subtracting the number of muffins Arthur already baked (35) from the desired number of muffins (83).\n\n35 muffins + muffins to bake = 83 muffins\n\nTo find the number of muffins Arthur needs to bake, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nmuffins to bake = 83 muffins - 35 muffins\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of muffins to bake:\n\nmuffins to bake = 83 - 35\n\nmuffins to bake = 48\n\nThe answer is 48 muffins.", "answer": 48, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/565.png"}
