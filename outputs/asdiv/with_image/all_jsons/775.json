{"question": "Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many apples were left unpacked?", "qid": "775", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of baskets that can be filled with 25 apples. We can do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per basket.\n\n495 apples \u00f7 25 apples per basket = 19.8 baskets\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a basket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of baskets.\n\n19.8 baskets \u2248 20 baskets\n\nNow, we can find the number of apples left unpacked by subtracting the total number of apples from the total number of apples in the baskets.\n\n495 apples - 20 baskets \u00d7 25 apples per basket = 495 apples - 500 apples = -5 apples\n\nHowever, we cannot have a negative number of apples, so the answer is 0 apples left unpacked.\n\nThe answer is 0 apples.", "answer": 20, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/775.png"}
