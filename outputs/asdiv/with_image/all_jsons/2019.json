{"question": "A pet store had forty-five puppies. In one day they sold thirty-nine of them and put the rest into cages with two in each cage. How many cages did they use?", "qid": "2019", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cages used to hold the remaining puppies. First, we need to find the number of puppies left after selling thirty-nine. Since there were forty-five puppies initially, and we sold thirty-nine, there are four puppies left.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of cages that can hold two puppies each. To do this, we can divide the number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage. 4 puppies \u00f7 2 puppies per cage = 2 cages.\n\nSo, the pet store used two cages to hold the remaining puppies.\n\nThe answer is 2 cages.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2019.png"}
