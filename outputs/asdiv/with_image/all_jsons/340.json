{"question": "Katie loves to travel. On her birthday, she decided to go on a trip on a mysterious continent. Her first destination was in an island of statues which is 436 miles from her place. She took a plane that made two stopovers, the 1st stopover after covering 132 miles and the 2nd stopover after another 236 miles. How much farther is the island from the 2nd stopover?", "qid": "340", "response": "To find the distance from the 2nd stopover to the island of statues, we need to add the distance traveled from the 1st stopover to the 2nd stopover.\n\n132 + 236 = 368\n\nSince Katie's first destination was in an island of statues which is 436 miles from her place, the island is 436 - 368 = 68 miles from the 2nd stopover.\n\nThe answer is 68.", "answer": 68, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/340.png"}
