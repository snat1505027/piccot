{"question": "On the first Saturday of spring, Jane woke up early to enjoy the whole day and help with chores at home. Jane had been saving large empty cans to serve as pots for sunflowers. If she has 54 sunflower seeds and there are 9 cans, how many seeds will be placed in each can if she places an equal number of seeds in each can?", "qid": "465", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of seeds that will be placed in each can. Since there are 54 seeds and 9 cans, we can divide the number of seeds by the number of cans to find the number of seeds per can.\n\n54 seeds \u00f7 9 cans = 6 seeds per can\n\nThe answer is 6 seeds per can.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/465.png"}
