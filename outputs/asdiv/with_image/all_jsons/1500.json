If the buffet uses 28 cases of ranch dressing, how many cases of caesar do they use?", "qid": "1500", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cases of caesar dressing used. We know that the ratio of ranch dressing to caesar dressing is 7:1. This means that for every 7 cases of ranch dressing, there is 1 case of caesar dressing.\n\nWe are given that the buffet uses 28 cases of ranch dressing. To find the number of cases of caesar dressing, we can divide 28 by 7.\n\n28 \u00f7 7 = 4\n\nThe answer is 4 cases of caesar dressing.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1500.png"}
