{"question": "The Razorback T-shirt Shop ordered 12 cases of t-shirts. If each case contains 24 t-shirts, how many t-shirts did they order?", "qid": "559", "response": "The Razorback T-shirt Shop ordered 12 cases of t-shirts. If each case contains 24 t-shirts, we need to find the total number of t-shirts ordered.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of t-shirts in one case. We can do this by dividing the number of cases by the number of t-shirts in each case:\n\n12 cases / 24 t-shirts per case = 0.5 cases\n\nSince we can't order a fraction of a case, we need to round up to the nearest whole case. This means we ordered 1 case of t-shirts.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of t-shirts ordered by multiplying the number of cases by the number of t-shirts in each case:\n\n1 case \\* 24 t-shirts per case = 24 t-shirts\n\nThe answer is 24 t-shirts.", "answer": 288, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/559.png"}
