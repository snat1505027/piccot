{"question": "Edward had 763 baseball cards in 7 binders. If each binder has the same number of cards, how many cards are in each binder?", "qid": "1423", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cards in each binder. We know that Edward has 763 baseball cards in total and they are placed in 7 binders. We can use the following equation to find the number of cards in each binder:\n\nNumber of cards in each binder = Total number of cards / Number of binders\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\nNumber of cards in each binder = 763 / 7\n\nNow, let's solve the equation:\n\nNumber of cards in each binder = 763 / 7\nNumber of cards in each binder = 109\n\nThe answer is 109.", "answer": 109, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1423.png"}
