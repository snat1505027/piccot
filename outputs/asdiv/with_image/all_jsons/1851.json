{"question": "A choir teacher is dividing 10 sopranos and 15 altos into singing groups. He wants each group to have the same combination of sopranos and altos, with no singers left over. What is the greatest number of groups he can make?", "qid": "1851", "response": "To find the greatest number of groups, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 15. The GCD of 10 and 15 is 5.\n\nNow, we can divide 10 by 5 and 15 by 5 to find the number of groups we can make. 10 divided by 5 is 2, and 15 divided by 5 is 3.\n\nSo, the greatest number of groups the choir teacher can make is 2.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1851.png"}
