{"question": "Jerry's freezer had 30 ice cubes in it. If he had to get ice for 6 cups, how many pieces should he put in each cup to make them have the same amount?", "qid": "1584", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ice cubes per cup. First, we need to find the total number of ice cubes needed for 6 cups. We can do this by dividing the number of ice cubes in the freezer by the number of cups needed.\n\n30 ice cubes in freezer \u00f7 6 cups needed = 5 ice cubes per cup\n\nSince there are 30 ice cubes in the freezer and we need 5 ice cubes per cup, we can conclude that Jerry should put 30 \u00f7 6 = 5 ice cubes in each cup to make them have the same amount.\n\nThe answer is 5 ice cubes per cup.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1584.png"}
