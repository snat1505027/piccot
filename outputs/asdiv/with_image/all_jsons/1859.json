{"question": "Morris observed two types of birds traveling: ducks and cranes. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 13, the cranes traveled in flocks of 17. If Morris observed the same total number of ducks and cranes, what is the smallest number of ducks that he could have observed?", "qid": "1859", "response": "To find the smallest number of ducks, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of 13 and is also a multiple of 17. We can start by finding the smallest multiple of 17, which is 17. Then, we need to find the smallest multiple of 13 that is greater than or equal to 17. The smallest multiple of 13 that is greater than or equal to 17 is 206, which is also a multiple of 17. Therefore, the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed is 206.\n\nThe answer is 206.", "answer": 221, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1859.png"}
