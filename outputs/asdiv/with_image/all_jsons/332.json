If Lizzie's group covered 238 houses while the other group covered 190, how many more houses remain?", "qid": "332", "response": "To find the number of houses covered by Lizzie's group, we can multiply the number of houses by the percentage of houses covered by the group.\n\n453 houses in the city x 238 houses covered by Lizzie's group / 100% = 238 houses covered by Lizzie's group\n\nTo find the number of houses covered by the other group, we can multiply the number of houses by the percentage of houses covered by the group.\n\n453 houses in the city x 190 houses covered by the other group / 100% = 190 houses covered by the other group\n\nSince Lizzie's group covered 238 houses and the other group covered 190 houses, the total number of houses covered by both groups is 238 + 190 = 428 houses.\n\nTo find the number of houses remaining, we can subtract the total number of houses covered by both groups from the total number of houses in the city.\n\n453 houses in the city - 428 houses covered by both groups = 25 houses remaining\n\nThe answer is 25 houses remaining.", "answer": 25, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/332.png"}
