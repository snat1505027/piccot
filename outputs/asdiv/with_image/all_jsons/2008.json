{"question": "April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was eight dollars. If Vanessa bought three roses and three daisies, how much did she spend?", "qid": "2008", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount spent by Vanessa on the flowers. We know that each rose costs eight dollars, and there are three roses in the image. We also know that there are three daisies, but their price is not given.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of flowers. There are three roses and three daisies, so the total number of flowers is six.\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount spent on the flowers. Since each rose costs eight dollars, the total amount spent on the roses is 3 x 8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.\n\nSince the price of the daisies is not given, we cannot include them in the total amount spent. Therefore, the total amount spent on the flowers is $24.\n\nThe answer is $24.", "answer": 48, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2008.png"}
