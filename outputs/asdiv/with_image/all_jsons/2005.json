{"question": "Zoe was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found eight boxes of clothing and inside each box there were four scarves and six mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Zoe have total?", "qid": "2005", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of scarves and mittens. There are eight boxes, and each box contains four scarves and six mittens. So, the total number of scarves is 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32. The total number of mittens is 8 x 6 = <<8*6=48>>48.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing. We can do this by adding the total number of scarves and mittens. The total number of pieces of winter clothing is 32 scarves + 48 mittens = <<32+48=80>>80.\n\nThe answer is 80.", "answer": 80, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2005.png"}
