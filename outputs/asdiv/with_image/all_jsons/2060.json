{"question": "Samuel had 14 Skittles. If Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his 4 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Skittles did each person eat?", "qid": "2060", "response": "First, we need to find out how many Skittles Samuel had initially. We know that he had 14 Skittles and gave equal numbers of Skittles to his 4 friends. So, we can find the number of Skittles each friend received by dividing the total number of Skittles by the number of friends.\n\n14 Skittles \u00f7 4 friends = 3.5 Skittles per friend\n\nSince we cannot divide Skittles into half, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n3.5 Skittles \u00f7 4 friends = 0.875 Skittles per friend\n\nNow, we need to find out how many Skittles were left after Samuel ate what was left. We can do this by subtracting the number of Skittles each friend received from the initial number of Skittles.\n\n14 Skittles - 4 \u00d7 0.875 Skittles = 14 - 3.5 = 10.5 Skittles\n\nSince we cannot divide Skittles into half, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n10.5 Skittles \u00f7 4 friends = 2.625 Skittles per friend\n\nAgain, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n2.625 Skittles \u00f7 4 friends = 0.65625 Skittles per friend\n\nFinally, we can find out how many Skittles Samuel ate by subtracting the number of Skittles each friend received from the total number of Skittles.\n\n14 Skittles - 4 \u00d7 0.65625 Skittles = 14 - 2.625 = 11.375 Skittles\n\nSince we cannot divide Skittles into half, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n11.375 Skittles \u00f7 4 friends = 2.84375 Skittles per friend\n\nAgain, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n2.84375 Skittles \u00f7 4 friends = 0.71125 Skittles per friend\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2060.png"}
