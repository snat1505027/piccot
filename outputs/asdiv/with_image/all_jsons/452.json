{"question": "Allen, Shiela's brother, likes to play with blocks. Shiela repainted Allen's old blocks in different colors. If Allen has 49 identical blocks and there are 7 blocks for every color of paint used, how many colors did Shiela use?", "qid": "452", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of colors used by Shiela. We know that Allen has 49 blocks and there are 7 blocks for every color of paint used. Let's start by finding the number of blocks for each color of paint.\n\n49 blocks \u00f7 7 blocks per color = 7 colors\n\nSince we know there are 7 blocks for each color, we can find the total number of blocks for all colors by multiplying the number of colors by the number of blocks per color.\n\n7 colors \u00d7 7 blocks per color = 49 blocks\n\nSince the number of blocks is the same as the number of colors, we can conclude that Shiela used 7 different colors to repaint Allen's blocks.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/452.png"}
