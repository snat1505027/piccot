{"question": "Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?", "qid": "841", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. We know that Rita and Peter weigh the same amount, so we can represent that as 68 pounds. We also know that Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together, so we can represent that as 68 pounds.\n\nSince Rita and Peter weigh the same amount, we can write that as 68 pounds. Now, we can add the weight of Rita and Peter to find the total weight of Rita and Peter: 68 pounds + 68 pounds = 136 pounds.\n\nSince the total weight of Rita, Peter, and Skeeter is 90 pounds, we can subtract the weight of Rita and Peter from the total weight to find the weight of Skeeter: 90 pounds - 136 pounds = -46 pounds.\n\nHowever, this answer is not possible since the weight of Skeeter cannot be negative. This means there is an error in the problem statement or the calculations. The answer is not provided.", "answer": 46, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/841.png"}
