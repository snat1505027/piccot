The pattern is that the number of flowers in each vase is the sum of the previous two vases.\n\n5 + 7 = 12\n10 + 14 = 24\n\nSo, the number of flowers in the fifth vase is the sum of the previous two vases, which is 24.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 19, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1065.png"}
