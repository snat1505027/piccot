{"question": "The ratio of the cost of a DVD player to the cost of a movie is 9:2. A DVD player costs $63 more than a movie. What is the cost of a DVD player?", "qid": "1036", "response": "The ratio of the cost of a DVD player to the cost of a movie is 9:2.\nLet's call the cost of a movie x.\nThen, the cost of a DVD player is 9x + 63.\n\nWe know that the cost of a DVD player is $63 more than a movie, so we can set up an equation:\n9x + 63 = x + 63\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n9x = x + 63\n9x - x = 63\n8x = 63\nx = 63 / 8\nx = 7.875\n\nSince the cost of a movie cannot be a fraction, we can round it to the nearest whole number. The cost of a movie is $7.875 - 63 = $7.815.\n\nThe cost of a DVD player is $63 more than a movie, so the cost of a DVD player is $7.815 + $63 = $8.445.\n\nThe answer is $8.445.", "answer": 81, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1036.png"}
