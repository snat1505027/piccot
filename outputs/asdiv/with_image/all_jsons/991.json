{"question": "A baker is putting cupcakes on trays to cool. She put 3 cupcakes on the first tray, 6 cupcakes on the second tray, 12 cupcakes on the third tray, and 24 cupcakes on the fourth tray. If this pattern continues, how many cupcakes will the baker put on the fifth tray?", "qid": "991", "response": "To find the number of cupcakes on the fifth tray, we need to find the pattern in which the baker is placing the cupcakes. The baker is adding the number of cupcakes on the previous tray to the number of cupcakes on the current tray.\n\n1. 3 cupcakes on the first tray.\n2. 6 cupcakes on the second tray (3 + 3).\n3. 12 cupcakes on the third tray (6 + 6).\n4. 24 cupcakes on the fourth tray (12 + 12).\n\nTo find the number of cupcakes on the fifth tray, we need to add the number of cupcakes on the fourth tray to the number of cupcakes on the fifth tray.\n\n5. Number of cupcakes on the fifth tray = 24 + x\n\nSince the baker is following a pattern, we can find the value of x by looking at the difference between the number of cupcakes on the fourth tray and the number of cupcakes on the fifth tray.\n\n4. 24 cupcakes on the fourth tray.\n5. 24 + x = 24 + (4 - 4) = 24 + 0 = 24\n\nThe baker will put 24 cupcakes on the fifth tray.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 48, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/991.png"}
