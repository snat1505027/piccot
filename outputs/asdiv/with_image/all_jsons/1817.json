{"question": "In preparation for a party, Brant is putting desserts onto platters. The chocolate cake is cut into 15 pieces and the cheesecake is cut into 6 pieces. If he wants to prepare identical platters without having any cake left over, what is the greatest number of platters he can prepare?", "qid": "1817", "response": "To prepare identical platters without having any cake left over, Brant needs to ensure that the total number of pieces of chocolate cake and cheesecake is evenly distributed across the platters.\n\nLet's start by finding the total number of pieces of chocolate cake and cheesecake.\n\n15 pieces of chocolate cake + 6 pieces of cheesecake = 21 pieces of dessert.\n\nSince Brant wants to prepare identical platters, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of platters.\n\n21 pieces of dessert \u00f7 number of platters = 21 \u00f7 x\n\nTo find the greatest number of platters, we need to maximize the result of this equation.\n\n21 \u00f7 x = 21 \u00f7 2 = 10.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a platter, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe greatest number of platters Brant can prepare is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1817.png"}
