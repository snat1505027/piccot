{"question": "Eddie is thinking of a number that is divisible by both 8 and 5. What is the smallest possible number that Eddie could be thinking of?", "qid": "912", "response": "To find the smallest possible number that is divisible by both 8 and 5, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 5. The GCD of 8 and 5 is 1.\n\nNow, we can find the smallest possible number by multiplying the two numbers together and then dividing the result by the GCD. In this case, the smallest possible number is 40, which is the product of 8 and 5 (8 x 5 = 40).\n\nThe answer is 40.", "answer": 40, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/912.png"}
