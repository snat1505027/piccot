{"question": "A bathroom had a length of 4 feet and a total area of 8 square feet. What is the width of the bathroom?", "qid": "1456", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the bathroom. We know that the bathroom has a length of 4 feet and a total area of 8 square feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width.\n\nArea = Length x Width\n\nSince we know the length is 4 feet, we can set up the equation:\n\n8 = 4 x Width\n\nNow, we need to solve for the width. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n2 = Width\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate the width:\n\n2 x 2 = Width\n\n4 = Width\n\nThe width of the bathroom is 4 feet.\n\nThe answer is 4 feet.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1456.png"}
