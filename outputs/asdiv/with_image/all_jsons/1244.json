We know that there are currently thirty-three rose bushes and thirty-seven oak trees in the park. We also know that when the workers are finished, there will be ninety-eight rose bushes in the park.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of rose bushes that were already in the park. We can do this by subtracting the number of oak trees from the total number of rose bushes and oak trees:\n\n33 + 37 = 69\n\nNow, we need to find the number of rose bushes that the workers planted today. We can do this by subtracting the number of rose bushes that were already in the park from the total number of rose bushes that will be in the park after the workers are finished:\n\n98 - 69 = 29\n\nThe answer is 29.", "answer": 65, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1244.png"}
