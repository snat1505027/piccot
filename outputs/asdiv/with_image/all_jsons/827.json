{"question": "Cindy and Dan have the same number of stickers. Cindy used 15 of her stickers. Dan bought 18 more stickers. How many more stickers did Dan have than Cindy then?", "qid": "827", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of stickers Dan has and the number of stickers Cindy has.\n\nDan has 18 more stickers than Cindy, so we can write the equation as:\n\nDan's stickers - Cindy's stickers = 18\n\nCindy used 15 of her stickers, so we can substitute that value in the equation:\n\nDan's stickers - 15 = 18\n\nNow, we can solve for Dan's stickers:\n\nDan's stickers = 18 + 15\nDan's stickers = 33\n\nThe answer is 33.", "answer": 33, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/827.png"}
