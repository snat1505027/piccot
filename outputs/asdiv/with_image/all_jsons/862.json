{"question": "Mom made 32 chocolate chip cookies. It took 24 minutes to mix the ingredients and 16 minutes to bake. Julie and Matt ate 9 cookies after dinner. How many cookies were left?", "qid": "862", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies left after Julie and Matt ate 9 cookies.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of cookies that were made. The image shows that 32 chocolate chip cookies were made.\n\nNext, we need to find the total time it took to make the cookies. The image shows that it took 24 minutes to mix the ingredients and 16 minutes to bake. To find the total time, we add these two numbers together: 24 + 16 = 40 minutes.\n\nNow, we can find the number of cookies left by dividing the total number of cookies by the total time it took to make them. 32 cookies / 40 minutes = 0.8 cookies per minute.\n\nSince we know that 9 cookies were eaten, we can find the number of minutes it took for Julie and Matt to eat the cookies by dividing the number of cookies eaten by the number of cookies per minute. 9 cookies / 0.8 cookies per minute = 11.25 minutes.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of cookies left by subtracting the time it took for Julie and Matt to eat the cookies from the total time it took to make the cookies. 40 minutes - 11.25 minutes = 28.75 minutes.\n\nTo find the number of cookies left, we can divide the total number of cookies by the remaining time. 32 cookies / 28.75 minutes = 1.12 cookies per minute.\n\nSince we know that 9 cookies were eaten, we can find the number of minutes it took for Julie and Matt to eat the cookies by dividing the number of cookies eaten by the number of cookies per minute. 9 cookies / 1.12 cookies per minute = 8.12 minutes.\n\nSince we know that 9 cookies were eaten, we can find the number of cookies left by subtracting the time it took for Julie and Matt to eat the cookies from the total time it took to make the cookies. 40 minutes - 8.12 minutes = 31.88 minutes.\n\nTo find the number of cookies left, we can divide the total number of cookies by the remaining time. 32 cookies /", "answer": 23, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/862.png"}
