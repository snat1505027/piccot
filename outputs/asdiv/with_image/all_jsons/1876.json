{"question": "I am planting 50 apple trees and 30 peach trees. I want the same number and type of trees per row. What is the maximum number of trees I can plant per row?", "qid": "1876", "response": "To find the maximum number of trees per row, we need to find the common number of trees between the two types.\n\nFirst, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 50 and 30. The LCM of 50 and 30 is 150.\n\nNext, we divide the LCM by each of the original numbers:\n150 / 50 = 3\n150 / 30 = 5\n\nSince the LCM of 50 and 30 is 150, and we can divide it by both numbers to get 3 and 5, we can plant 3 apple trees and 5 peach trees per row.\n\nThe answer is 3 apple trees and 5 peach trees per row.", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1876.png"}
