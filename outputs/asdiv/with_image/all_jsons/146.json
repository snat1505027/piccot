{"question": "Mrs. Hilt and her sister drove to a concert 78 miles away. They drove 32 miles and then stopped for gas. Her sister put 28 gallons of gas in the car. How many miles did they have left to drive?", "qid": "146", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the distance they have left to drive after stopping for gas. We can do this by subtracting the distance they have already driven (32 miles) from the total distance to the concert (78 miles).\n\n32 + 28 = 60 gallons of gas\n\n60 gallons of gas / 28 gallons per mile = 2.14 miles per gallon\n\n78 miles - 32 miles = 46 miles\n\n46 miles / 2.14 miles per gallon = 21.61 gallons of gas\n\n21.61 gallons of gas / 28 gallons per mile = 0.77 miles\n\nThe answer is 0.77 miles.", "answer": 46, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/146.png"}
