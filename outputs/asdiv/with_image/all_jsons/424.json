{"question": "There are 3 more sections that are undeveloped. Each of the remaining sections has a land area of 2435 square feet. What is the total area of the undeveloped land?", "qid": "424", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the undeveloped land. We know that there are 3 more sections that are undeveloped, and each of the remaining sections has a land area of 2435 square feet.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of one section. We can do this by multiplying the length and width of the section. Since the image does not provide the dimensions of the section, we cannot calculate the area of one section.\n\nNext, we need to find the total area of the undeveloped land. To do this, we need to multiply the area of one section by the number of sections that are undeveloped. Since there are 3 more sections that are undeveloped, we can find the total area by multiplying the area of one section by 3.\n\nThe answer is 3 x 2435 square feet = 7305 square feet.", "answer": 7305, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/424.png"}
