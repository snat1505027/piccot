{"question": "Mrs. Hilt saw 33 butterflies. Some of the butterflies were red and others were orange. If 20 of the butterflies were orange, how many of them were red?", "qid": "151", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red butterflies. Let's start by using the information given in the image. Mrs. Hilt saw 33 butterflies, and 20 of them were orange. We can represent this information in a table:\n\n| Butterflies | Orange | Red |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | 33 |  |\n| Orange | 20 |  |\n| Red |  |  |\n\nSince we know that 20 of the butterflies were orange, we can find the number of red butterflies by subtracting the number of orange butterflies from the total number of butterflies.\n\nThe answer is 33 - 20 = 13.", "answer": 13, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/151.png"}
