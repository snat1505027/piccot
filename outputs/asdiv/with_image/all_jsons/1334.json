{"question": "An eight ft board is cut into two pieces. One piece is 2 ft longer than the other. How long are the pieces?", "qid": "1334", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each piece. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\n1. The board is 8 ft long.\n2. One piece is 2 ft longer than the other.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the shorter piece. We can do this by subtracting 2 ft from the total length of the board:\n\n8 ft - 2 ft = 6 ft\n\nNow, we know that the shorter piece is 6 ft long. To find the length of the longer piece, we can add 2 ft to the length of the shorter piece:\n\n6 ft + 2 ft = 8 ft\n\nNow we know that the longer piece is 8 ft long.\n\nThe answer is: The shorter piece is 6 ft long, and the longer piece is 8 ft long.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1334.png"}
