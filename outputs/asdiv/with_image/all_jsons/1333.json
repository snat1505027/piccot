{"question": "A 6 ft board is cut into two pieces, one twice as long as the other. How long are the pieces?", "qid": "1333", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the image. The image shows a 6 ft board cut into two pieces, with one piece being twice as long as the other. We can start by drawing a diagram to represent the situation.\n\n1. Draw a 6 ft board.\n2. Cut the board into two pieces.\n3. Label one piece as \"x\" and the other as \"2x\".\n\nNow, we can use the information that \"2x\" is twice as long as \"x\". We can represent this relationship using the following equation:\n\n2x = x + x\n\nTo solve for \"x\", we can simplify the equation by adding \"x\" to both sides:\n\n2x = 2x + x\n2x = 3x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 to isolate \"x\":\n\nx = 2/3\n\nThe answer is 2/3 ft.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1333.png"}
