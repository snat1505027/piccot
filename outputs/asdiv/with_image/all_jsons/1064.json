{"question": "While sorting some change into piggy banks, Diane put 72 coins in the first piggy bank, 81 coins in the second piggy bank, 90 coins in the third piggy bank, 99 coins in the fourth piggy bank, and 108 coins in the fifth piggy bank. If this pattern continues, how many coins will Diane put in the sixth piggy bank?", "qid": "1064", "response": "To find the number of coins in the sixth piggy bank, we need to find the pattern in which the coins are being placed. The pattern is that the number of coins in each piggy bank increases by 9.\n\n1. 72 + 9 = 81\n2. 81 + 9 = 90\n3. 90 + 9 = 99\n4. 99 + 9 = 108\n\nTo find the number of coins in the sixth piggy bank, we add 9 to 108:\n\n108 + 9 = 117\n\nThe answer is 117.", "answer": 117, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1064.png"}
