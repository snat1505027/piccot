{"question": "Sam and Carlos are bowling with plastic pins in Sam's living room. Remarkably, Sam knocks down 8 pins on every bowl, and Carlos knocks down 9 pins on every bowl. At the end of the day, Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins. What is the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down?", "qid": "1833", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pins that Sam and Carlos have knocked down. Since they have the same total number of pins, we can set up an equation:\n\nSam's total pins knocked down = Carlos' total pins knocked down\n\nWe know that Sam knocks down 8 pins on every bowl, and Carlos knocks down 9 pins on every bowl. Let's assume that Sam has knocked down x pins and Carlos has knocked down y pins.\n\nFrom the equation, we can derive the following:\n\n8x = 9y\n\nNow, we need to find the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down. To do this, we can try different combinations of x and y, and find the smallest one that satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's start with x = 1 and y = 9. This combination satisfies the equation, and the total number of pins knocked down is 1 + 9 = 10.\n\nNow, let's try x = 2 and y = 7. This combination also satisfies the equation, and the total number of pins knocked down is 2 + 7 = 9.\n\nSince 9 is the smallest total number of pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down, the answer is 9.", "answer": 72, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1833.png"}
