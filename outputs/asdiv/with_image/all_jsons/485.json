{"question": "Matt had 4 small cans of gold paint. If the 34 stars that they made were to be distributed equally to the cans of paint, how many stars will be left unpainted?", "qid": "485", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of stars that can be painted with each can of paint. We can do this by dividing the total number of stars (34) by the number of cans of paint (4).\n\n34 stars \u00f7 4 cans of paint = 8.5 stars per can\n\nSince we cannot paint a fraction of a star, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of stars per can.\n\n8.5 stars \u00f7 1 can = 8.5 stars per can\n\nNow, we can find the number of stars that will be left unpainted by subtracting the number of stars that can be painted from the total number of stars.\n\n34 stars - 8.5 stars = 25.5 stars left unpainted\n\nThe answer is 25.5 stars left unpainted.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/485.png"}
