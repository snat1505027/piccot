{"question": "Marian also prepared 59 croissants which she plans to give to her 8 neighbors. If each neighbor received and equal number of croissants, how many will be left with Marian?", "qid": "471", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many croissants Marian will have left after giving them to her 8 neighbors. We can do this by dividing the total number of croissants by the number of neighbors.\n\n59 croissants \u00f7 8 neighbors = 7.375 croissants per neighbor\n\nSince we cannot divide croissants into fractions, we need to round the number of croissants per neighbor to the nearest whole number.\n\n7.375 croissants per neighbor \u2248 7 croissants per neighbor\n\nNow, we can find out how many croissants Marian will have left by subtracting the total number of croissants given to her neighbors from the total number of croissants.\n\n59 croissants - (8 neighbors x 7 croissants per neighbor) = 59 croissants - 56 croissants = 3 croissants left with Marian\n\nThe answer is 3 croissants.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/471.png"}
