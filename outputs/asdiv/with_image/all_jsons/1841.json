{"question": "Ronald and Tim both did their laundry today. Ronald does laundry every 6 days and Tim does laundry every 9 days. How many days will it be until Ronald and Tim both do laundry on the same day again?", "qid": "1841", "response": "To find the number of days until Ronald and Tim both do laundry on the same day again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 9.\n\nFirst, we can find the prime factors of 6 and 9:\n6 = 2^2 \\* 3\n9 = 3^2\n\nNext, we can find the LCM by multiplying the prime factors of both numbers:\nLCM(6, 9) = 2^2 \\* 3 \\* 3 = 36\n\nSince Ronald does laundry every 6 days and Tim does laundry every 9 days, it will be 36 days until they both do laundry on the same day again.\n\nThe answer is 36.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1841.png"}
