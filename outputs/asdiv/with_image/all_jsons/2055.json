{"question": "Nancy sold 45 boxes of Tagalongs. How many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?", "qid": "2055", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cases of 12 boxes Nancy needs, and then add extra boxes to that number.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many boxes Nancy needs to make 12 cases. We can do this by dividing the number of boxes she sold (45) by the number of boxes per case (12).\n\n45 boxes \u00f7 12 boxes/case = 3.75 cases\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a case, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of cases.\n\n3.75 cases \u2248 4 cases\n\nNow, we need to find out how many extra boxes Nancy needs. We can do this by subtracting the number of boxes in 4 cases from the total number of boxes she sold.\n\n45 boxes - (4 cases \u00d7 12 boxes/case) = 45 boxes - 48 boxes = -3 boxes\n\nSince we can't have a negative number of boxes, we need to add 3 boxes to the number of boxes in 4 cases to get the correct answer.\n\n4 cases + 3 boxes = 7 cases\n\nThe answer is 7 cases of 12 boxes, plus 3 extra boxes.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2055.png"}
