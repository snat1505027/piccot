{"question": "While playing at the arcade, Kaleb won eight tickets playing 'whack a mole' and seven tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost five tickets a piece, how many could he buy?", "qid": "1993", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many tickets Kaleb has in total. We can do this by adding the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'.\n\n8 tickets (whack a mole) + 7 tickets (skee ball) = 15 tickets\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pieces of candy Kaleb can buy with 15 tickets. We know that each piece of candy costs five tickets.\n\n15 tickets / 5 tickets per piece = 3 pieces of candy\n\nThe answer is 3 pieces of candy.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1993.png"}
