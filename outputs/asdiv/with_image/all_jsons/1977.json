{"question": "For a birthday party Cody bought thirty regular sodas and five diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold seven on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?", "qid": "1977", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many shelves Cody would need to fill up with sodas. We can do this by dividing the total number of sodas (30) by the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf (7).\n\n30 sodas \u00f7 7 sodas per shelf = 4.33 shelves\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of shelves.\n\n4.33 shelves \u2248 5 shelves\n\nThe answer is 5 shelves.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1977.png"}
