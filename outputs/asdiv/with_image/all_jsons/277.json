Let's start by using the information we have:\n\n1. She had $69.00 before buying cookies and juice.\n2. She spent $60.00 on cookies.\n3. She has $50.00 left after buying cookies.\n\nWe can use the information to create an equation:\n\n$69.00 - $60.00 = $50.00\n\nNow, we need to find the amount spent on juice. We can do this by subtracting the amount spent on cookies from the initial amount of money she had:\n\n$69.00 - $50.00 = $19.00\n\nThe answer is $19.00.", "answer": 19, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/277.png"}
