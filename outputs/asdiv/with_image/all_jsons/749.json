{"question": "9 boys went to water trees. There were 29 trees. If each of them watered the equal amount of trees, how many trees are left?", "qid": "749", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of trees each boy watered. We can do this by dividing the total number of trees by the number of boys.\n\n29 trees / 9 boys = 3.2222 trees per boy\n\nSince trees cannot be watered in a fraction, we need to round the number of trees per boy to the nearest whole number.\n\n3.2222 trees per boy \u2248 3 trees per boy\n\nNow, we can find the total number of trees watered by each boy by multiplying the number of trees per boy by the number of boys.\n\n3 trees per boy \u00d7 9 boys = 27 trees watered by each boy\n\nSince there are 29 trees in total, the number of trees left after each boy has watered their share is:\n\n29 trees - 27 trees watered by each boy = 2 trees left\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/749.png"}
