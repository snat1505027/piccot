{"question": "For dessert, Jane's mom prepared 12 pieces of bite-size cinnamon swirls. If the three of them ate an equal number of pieces of cinnamon swirls, how many pieces did Jane eat?", "qid": "469", "response": "First, we need to find the number of pieces of cinnamon swirls that the three people ate. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of people.\n\n12 pieces of cinnamon swirls \u00f7 3 people = 4 pieces of cinnamon swirls per person\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pieces Jane ate. Since the image shows that Jane ate 4 pieces of cinnamon swirls, we can conclude that she ate the same number of pieces as the other two people.\n\n4 pieces of cinnamon swirls \u00f7 3 people = 1.33 pieces of cinnamon swirls per person\n\nSince we cannot eat a fraction of a piece, we can round up the number of pieces to the nearest whole number.\n\n1.33 pieces of cinnamon swirls \u2248 1 piece of cinnamon swirls per person\n\nTherefore, Jane ate 1 piece of cinnamon swirls.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/469.png"}
