{"question": "Paige uploaded thirty-five pictures to Facebook. She put fourteen pics into one album and put the rest into three different albums. How many pictures were in each of the three albums?", "qid": "2026", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pictures in each of the three albums. We know that Paige uploaded a total of thirty-five pictures and put fourteen of them into one album. This means that she has thirty-five - fourteen = <<35-14=21>>21 pictures left to distribute among the three albums.\n\nSince there are three albums, we can divide the remaining twenty-one pictures by three to find the number of pictures in each album. 21 \u00f7 3 = <<21/3=7>>7. Therefore, each of the three albums has seven pictures.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2026.png"}
