{"question": "Mila's father has 2 jobs. 1st job pays $375 more than the 2nd job. How much does he get from the 1st job if he gets per week a total of $3,875?", "qid": "1017", "response": "The image shows a table with the total income of Mila's father and the income from each job. The table shows that the income from the first job is $3,500 and the income from the second job is $3,275.\n\nTo find the difference between the two jobs, we can subtract the income from the second job from the income from the first job: $3,500 - $3,275 = $225.\n\nSince Mila's father has 2 jobs, we can add the income from both jobs to find the total income: $3,500 + $3,275 = $6,775.\n\nTo find the income from the first job, we can subtract the income from the second job from the total income: $6,775 - $3,275 = $3,500.\n\nThe answer is $3,500.", "answer": 2125, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1017.png"}
