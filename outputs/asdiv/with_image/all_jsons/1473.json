{"question": "An island in the Indian Ocean was 4 miles wide and 7 miles long. What is the perimeter of the island?", "qid": "1473", "response": "To find the perimeter of the island, we need to use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length of the island is 7 miles, and the width is 4 miles.\n\nP = 2L + 2W\nP = 2(7) + 2(4)\nP = 14 + 8\nP = 22\n\nThe perimeter of the island is 22 miles.\n\nThe answer is 22.", "answer": 22, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1473.png"}
