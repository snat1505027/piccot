{"question": "A classroom had 35 glue sticks. If the ratio of glue sticks to glue bottles was 5:2, how many glue bottles did the classroom have?", "qid": "1488", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of glue bottles in the classroom. We know that the ratio of glue sticks to glue bottles is 5:2. Let's start by finding the number of glue bottles.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of glue sticks in the classroom. The image shows that there are 35 glue sticks.\n2. Next, we need to find the number of glue bottles by applying the ratio of 5:2. To do this, we can either multiply the number of glue sticks by 2 or divide the number of glue sticks by 5.\n\n3. If we multiply the number of glue sticks by 2, we get:\n35 glue sticks \\* 2 = 70 glue bottles\n\n4. Alternatively, if we divide the number of glue sticks by 5, we get:\n35 glue sticks \u00f7 5 = 7 glue bottles\n\n5. Since both methods give the same result, we can conclude that the classroom had 70 glue bottles.\n\nThe answer is 70 glue bottles.", "answer": 14, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1488.png"}
