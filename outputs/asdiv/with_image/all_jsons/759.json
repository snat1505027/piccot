{"question": "There are 32 students in the class. The teacher divided them into 5 equal groups. How many students are left?", "qid": "759", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students left in each group after dividing the class into 5 equal groups.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of students per group. To do this, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups: 32 students / 5 groups = 6.4 students per group.\n\nNext, we need to round the average number of students per group to the nearest whole number, since we cannot have a fraction of a student. We round 6.4 to 6 students per group.\n\nNow, we can find the number of students left in each group by subtracting the average number of students per group from the total number of students:\n\n32 students - 6 students per group = 26 students left in each group.\n\nSince there are 5 groups, the total number of students left in each group is 26 students \\* 5 groups = 130 students left in each group.\n\nThe answer is 130 students left in each group.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/759.png"}
