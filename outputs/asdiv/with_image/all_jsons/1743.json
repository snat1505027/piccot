{"question": "At the zoo a cage had sixty-eight snakes. If forty-two were hiding, how many snakes were not hiding? ", "qid": "1743", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of snakes that were not hiding. We can do this by subtracting the number of snakes hiding from the total number of snakes in the cage.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of snakes hiding. We know that forty-two snakes were hiding, so we can write this as 42.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of snakes in the cage. We can do this by adding the number of snakes hiding to the number of snakes not hiding.\n\nSince there are sixty-eight snakes in the cage and forty-two of them are hiding, there are sixty-eight - forty-two = <<68-42=26>>26 snakes not hiding.\n\nThe answer is 26.", "answer": 26, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1743.png"}
