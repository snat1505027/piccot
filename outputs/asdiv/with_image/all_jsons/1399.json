{"question": "A botanist picked six hundred one flowers. She wanted to put them into eight bouquets with the same number of flowers in each. How many more should she pick so she doesn't have any extra?", "qid": "1399", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of flowers per bouquet. We can do this by dividing the total number of flowers (601) by the number of bouquets (8).\n\n601 \u00f7 8 = 75\n\nThis means that each bouquet will have 75 flowers. Now, we need to find out how many more flowers the botanist should pick to have exactly 75 flowers per bouquet.\n\nTo do this, we can subtract the current number of flowers per bouquet (75) from the total number of flowers (601) and then divide the result by the number of bouquets (8).\n\n(601 - 75) \u00f7 8 = 76\n\nThis means that the botanist should pick 76 more flowers to have exactly 75 flowers per bouquet.\n\nThe answer is 76.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1399.png"}
