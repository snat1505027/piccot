What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?", "qid": "1815", "response": "To find the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 20. The GCD of 18 and 20 is 2.\n\nSince Aylin wants to use the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page, she can create 2 pages with 9 photos and 10 newspaper clippings each.\n\nThe number of items left over is 0, which means Aylin can create 2 pages without any items left over.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1815.png"}
