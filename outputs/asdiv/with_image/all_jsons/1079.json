{"question": "A P.E. teacher needs to divide 14 male students and 7 female students into teams, each with the same combination of male students and female students and nobody left out. What is the greatest number of teams that can be formed?", "qid": "1079", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 7. The GCD of 14 and 7 is 7.\n\nNow, we can divide the total number of students (14 + 7 = 21) by the GCD (7) to find the number of teams. 21 \u00f7 7 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of teams that can be formed is 3.\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1079.png"}
