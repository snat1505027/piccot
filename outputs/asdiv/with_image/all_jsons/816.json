{"question": "A comic book costs 37 cents. The store owner reversed the digits by mistake. He wrote that number on the comic book. How much did the store owner overcharge his customer?", "qid": "816", "response": "The store owner reversed the digits of the comic book cost, so we need to find the original number. To do this, we can start by looking at the reversed number, which is 734. We can then reverse the digits again to get the original number.\n\n734 reversed is 437.\n\nSince the store owner overcharged his customer, the difference between the original cost and the reversed cost is the amount of overcharge.\n\nThe original cost is 37 cents, and the reversed cost is 437 cents.\n\nThe difference is 437 - 37 = 400 cents.\n\nThe store owner overcharged his customer by 400 cents.\n\nThe answer is 400 cents.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/816.png"}
