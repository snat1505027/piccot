{"question": "The distance travelled by Ben and Tim is in the ratio 3:4. The distance travelled by Ben is 18 miles. Find the distance travelled by Tim.", "qid": "800", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the distance travelled by Tim. We know that the distance travelled by Ben and Tim is in the ratio 3:4, and Ben travelled 18 miles. Let's start by setting up a proportion equation:\n\nBen's distance : Tim's distance = 3 : 4\n\nWe can substitute the given values into the equation:\n\n18 : x = 3 : 4\n\nNow, we need to solve for x, which represents Tim's distance. To do this, we can cross-multiply:\n\n18 \u00d7 4 = 3 \u00d7 x\n\n72 = 3x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 to simplify the equation:\n\n24 = x\n\nThe distance travelled by Tim is 24 miles.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 24, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/800.png"}
