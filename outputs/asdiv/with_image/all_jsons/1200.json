{"question": "The sum of the digits of a two digit number is 15. If the digits in the tenth place 8, find the two digit number.", "qid": "1200", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the two digit number whose digits add up to 15. Let's start by looking at the tenth place. The digit in the tenth place is 8.\n\nNow, we need to find the digit in the unit place. Since the sum of the digits is 15, we can find the digit in the unit place by subtracting the digit in the tenth place from 15. 15 - 8 = 7.\n\nSo, the two digit number is 87.\n\nThe answer is 87.", "answer": 87, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1200.png"}
