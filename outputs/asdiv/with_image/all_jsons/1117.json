{"question": "At the carnival, 6 friends bought 27 tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?", "qid": "1117", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tickets each friend would get if they split the 27 tickets equally.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of tickets per friend. To do this, we divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends:\n\n27 tickets / 6 friends = 4.5 tickets per friend\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a ticket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of tickets per friend.\n\n4.5 tickets per friend rounded up to the nearest whole number = 5 tickets per friend\n\nNow we know that each friend would get 5 tickets if they split the 27 tickets equally. To find out how many more tickets they would need to buy to reach this number, we subtract the current number of tickets per friend from the desired number of tickets per friend:\n\n5 tickets per friend - 4.5 tickets per friend = 0.5 tickets per friend\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a ticket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of tickets per friend.\n\n0.5 tickets per friend rounded up to the nearest whole number = 1 ticket per friend\n\nTherefore, the friends would need to buy 1 more ticket to reach the desired number of tickets per friend.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1117.png"}
