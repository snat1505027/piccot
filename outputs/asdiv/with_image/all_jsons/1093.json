{"question": "There are 40 girls and 32 boys who want to participate in 6th grade intramurals. If each team must have the same number of girls and the same number of boys, what is the greatest number of teams that can participate in intramurals?", "qid": "1093", "response": "To find the greatest number of teams that can participate in intramurals, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and the number of boys.\n\nGirls: 40\nBoys: 32\n\nThe GCD of 40 and 32 is 8.\n\nSince each team must have the same number of girls and boys, we can divide the number of girls and boys by 8 to find the number of teams that can participate in intramurals.\n\nGirls: 40 \u00f7 8 = 5\nBoys: 32 \u00f7 8 = 4\n\nThe greatest number of teams that can participate in intramurals is 5 teams with 4 boys on each team.\n\nThe answer is 5 teams with 4 boys on each team.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1093.png"}
