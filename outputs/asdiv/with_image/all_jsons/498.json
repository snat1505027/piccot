{"question": "Melody made 26 cut-outs of Christmas trees with red shiny balls. If she planned to paste 4 of this to the front cover of a certain number of cards, how many cards will she be able to make?", "qid": "498", "response": "Melody made 26 cut-outs of Christmas trees with red shiny balls. If she plans to paste 4 of these to the front cover of a certain number of cards, we need to find the number of cards she can make.\n\nLet's assume the number of cards is x. Since Melody plans to paste 4 cut-outs per card, we can say that 4x cut-outs will be used. Since she made 26 cut-outs, we can say that 26 - 4x = 0.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n4x = 26\nx = 26/4\nx = 6.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a card, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of cards. Therefore, Melody can make 7 cards using the 26 cut-outs with red shiny balls.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/498.png"}
