{"question": "Bill observed two types of birds in the bushes: sparrows and parrots. While the sparrows were in flocks of 13, the parrots were in flocks of 14. If Bill observed the same total number of sparrows and parrots, what is the smallest number of sparrows that he could have observed?", "qid": "1858", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number of sparrows that Bill could have observed while observing the same total number of sparrows and parrots.\n\nLet's start by finding the total number of birds that Bill observed. Since the parrots were in flocks of 14, we can find the total number of parrots by dividing the total number of birds by the number of parrots per flock:\n\nTotal number of parrots = Total number of birds / Number of parrots per flock\nTotal number of parrots = 100 / 14\nTotal number of parrots = 7.14 (rounded up to the nearest whole number)\n\nNow, we know that the sparrows were in flocks of 13. We can find the total number of sparrows by dividing the total number of birds by the number of sparrows per flock:\n\nTotal number of sparrows = Total number of birds / Number of sparrows per flock\nTotal number of sparrows = 100 / 13\nTotal number of sparrows = 7.69 (rounded up to the nearest whole number)\n\nSince the total number of sparrows is greater than the total number of parrots, we can conclude that Bill could have observed at least 7 sparrows. The smallest number of sparrows that Bill could have observed is 7.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 182, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1858.png"}
