{"question": "A piece of plywood was cut so its length was 6 feet by 5 feet. What is the perimeter of the wood?", "qid": "1460", "response": "To find the perimeter of the plywood, we need to use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width. In this case, L = 6 feet and W = 5 feet.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. So, L = 6 feet \\* 12 inches/foot = 72 inches and W = 5 feet \\* 12 inches/foot = 60 inches.\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter:\nP = 2L + 2W = 2 \\* 72 inches + 2 \\* 60 inches = 144 inches + 120 inches = 264 inches.\n\nThe answer is 264 inches.", "answer": 22, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1460.png"}
