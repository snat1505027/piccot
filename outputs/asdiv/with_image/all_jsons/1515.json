{"question": "A chess player won 48 of the games he played. If his ratio of wins to loses was 8:7, how many games did he play total?", "qid": "1515", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of games played by the chess player. We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\nThe chess player won 48 games and lost 7 games, which means he had a total of 48 + 7 = 55 games played.\n\nThe ratio of wins to loses was 8:7, which means that for every 8 games he won, he lost 7 games. To find the total number of games played, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal games played = (Number of wins / Ratio of wins to loses) + (Number of loses / Ratio of loses to wins)\n\nIn this case, the formula would be:\n\nTotal games played = (48 / 8) + (7 / 7)\n\nSimplifying the formula, we get:\n\nTotal games played = 6 + 1\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 90, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1515.png"}
