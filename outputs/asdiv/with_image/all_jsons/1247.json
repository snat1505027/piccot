{"question": "On Monday, three hundred ninety-six students went on a trip to the zoo. All seven buses were filled and four students had to travel in cars. How many students were in each bus ?", "qid": "1247", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in each bus. We can start by dividing the total number of students by the number of buses.\n\n396 students / 7 buses = 56 students per bus\n\nHowever, we also need to account for the four students who traveled in cars. To do this, we can add the number of students in cars to the number of students per bus.\n\n56 students per bus + 4 students in cars = 60 students per bus\n\nThe answer is 60 students per bus.", "answer": 56, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1247.png"}
