{"question": "Jenny goes to dance class every 6 days, karate class every 12 days, and to the library every 18 days. On December 1st she went to both classes and the libary. How many days from December 1st will she do both classes and go to the library?", "qid": "1867", "response": "To find the number of days from December 1st that Jenny will do both classes and go to the library, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 12, and 18.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of each number:\n\n6 = 2^2\n12 = 2^2 \\* 3\n18 = 2 \\* 3 \\* 3\n\nNext, we multiply the prime factors to find the LCM:\n\nLCM = 2^2 \\* 3 \\* 3 = 36\n\nSince the LCM is 36, Jenny will do both classes and go to the library on the 36th day from December 1st.\n\nThe answer is December 36th.", "answer": 36, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1867.png"}
