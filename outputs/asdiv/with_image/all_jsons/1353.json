{"question": "Kevin can mow a square lawn that is 30 meters of each side in 45 minutes. If he works at the same rate, how many minutes will it take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures 60 meters on each side?", "qid": "1353", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the lawn in square meters and then find the time it takes to mow the lawn in square meters.\n\n1. First, we need to find the area of the lawn in square meters. The lawn is 30 meters on each side, so the area is 30 x 30 = 900 square meters.\n2. Next, we need to find the time it takes to mow the lawn in square meters. The image shows that it takes 45 minutes to mow a lawn of 900 square meters.\n3. Now, we need to find the area of the lawn in square meters that measures 60 meters on each side. The area is 60 x 60 = 3600 square meters.\n4. To find the time it takes to mow this lawn, we can use the same formula as before: time = area / Kevin's mowing rate.\n5. The mowing rate is 900 square meters per 45 minutes, so we can calculate the time it takes to mow the 3600 square meters lawn:\ntime = 3600 / 900 = 4.11 minutes\n\nThe answer is 4.11 minutes.", "answer": 180, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1353.png"}
