{"question": "If you add 45 to a mystery number you will get 92. What is the mystery number?", "qid": "972", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the mystery number. We know that when we add 45 to the mystery number, we get 92. Let's start by assigning a value to the mystery number. Let's say the mystery number is x.\n\nNow, we can write the equation:\nx + 45 = 92\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to find the value of x. We can do this by subtracting 45 from 92:\n92 - 45 = x\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 45:\nx = 92 / 45\n\nx = 2\n\nThe mystery number is 2.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 47, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/972.png"}
