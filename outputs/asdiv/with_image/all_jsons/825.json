{"question": "London is 11 years old and Blair is 16 years old. Several years ago, Blair was twice as old as London. How old was London then?", "qid": "825", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. Blair is 16 years old, and several years ago, he was twice as old as London. So, we can set up an equation:\n\nBlair's age = 2 \\* London's age\n\nBlair's age = 16\n\nNow, we can solve for London's age:\n\nLondon's age = Blair's age / 2\n\nLondon's age = 16 / 2\n\nLondon's age = 8\n\nSo, when Blair was 16 years old, London was 8 years old. The answer is 8.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/825.png"}
