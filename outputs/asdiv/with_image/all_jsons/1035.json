{"question": "Two numbers are in the ratio 5:7. The difference between the numbers is 12. What is the larger number?", "qid": "1035", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the larger number. We know that the two numbers are in the ratio 5:7, which means that the larger number is 5 times the smaller number. We also know that the difference between the numbers is 12.\n\nLet's start by finding the smaller number. We can do this by dividing the larger number by 5:\n\nLarger number = 5 x Smaller number\nSmaller number = Larger number / 5\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the smaller number into the equation for the difference:\n\nDifference = Larger number - Smaller number\nDifference = (5 x Smaller number) - Smaller number\n\nWe can simplify this expression by combining like terms:\n\nDifference = 4 x Smaller number\n\nSince the difference is 12, we can set up an equation:\n\n4 x Smaller number = 12\n\nNow, we can solve for the smaller number by dividing both sides by 4:\n\nSmaller number = 12 / 4\nSmaller number = 3\n\nSo, the smaller number is 3. To find the larger number, we can use the ratio 5:7:\n\nLarger number = 5 x 3\nLarger number = 15\n\nThe larger number is 15.\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 42, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1035.png"}
