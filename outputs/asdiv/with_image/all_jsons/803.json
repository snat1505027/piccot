If you want to have the same number of each item for a party, what is the least number of packages of each you need to buy?", "qid": "803", "response": "To have the same number of each item for a party, we need to find the least number of packages of cups and plates needed.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of cups needed. Since cups are sold in packages of 5, we need to divide the total number of cups by 5.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of plates needed. Since plates are sold in packages of 10, we need to divide the total number of plates by 10.\n\nNow, we can find the least number of packages of each item needed by rounding up the number of cups and plates to the nearest package.\n\nThe answer is 5 packages of cups and 10 packages of plates.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/803.png"}
