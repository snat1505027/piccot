{"question": "An envelope from the post office is 6 inches wide with a total area of 36 square inches. What is the height of the envelope?", "qid": "1478", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the envelope. We know that the envelope is 6 inches wide and has a total area of 36 square inches. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the height:\n\nArea = width x height\n\nSince we know the width is 6 inches, we can set up the equation:\n\n36 = 6 x height\n\nNow, we need to solve for the height. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\nheight = 36 / 6\n\nheight = 6\n\nThe height of the envelope is 6 inches.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1478.png"}
