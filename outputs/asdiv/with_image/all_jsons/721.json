{"question": "A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?", "qid": "721", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pounds of clothes the washing machine washes per day when it is not fully loaded. We can do this by dividing the total amount of clothes to be washed by the number of pounds the washing machine can wash per day.\n\n200 pounds of clothes to be washed \u00f7 28 pounds of clothes washed per day = 7.14 pounds of clothes washed per day.\n\nSince the washing machine is not fully loaded, we can round this number down to 7 pounds of clothes washed per day.\n\nThe answer is 7 pounds of clothes washed per day.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/721.png"}
