{"question": "Jasper is in charge of the refreshments. He sold 27 bags of chips. He sold 8 fewer hot dogs than chips. He sold 12 more drinks than hot dogs. How many drinks did Jasper sell?", "qid": "924", "response": "First, we need to find out how many hot dogs Jasper sold. Since he sold 27 bags of chips and 8 fewer hot dogs, we can subtract 8 from 27 to get the number of hot dogs sold: 27 - 8 = 19.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more drinks Jasper sold than hot dogs. We know that he sold 12 more drinks than hot dogs, so we can add 12 to the number of hot dogs sold: 19 + 12 = 31.\n\nFinally, we can find out the total number of drinks Jasper sold by multiplying the number of hot dogs by 3: 31 \\* 3 = 93.\n\nThe answer is 93.", "answer": 31, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/924.png"}
