{"question": "One-third of a number minus seven gives eight. Find the number.", "qid": "1193", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number that, when multiplied by three, gives eight.\n\nLet's start by dividing the number by three to find the quotient:\n\nNumber \u00f7 3 = 8\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when the number is divided by three. To do this, we can use the division sign (\u00f7) and the remainder sign (%):\n\nNumber \u00f7 3 % 3 = 8\n\nThe remainder is 8, which is the same as the result we are looking for. Therefore, the number is 24.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 45, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1193.png"}
