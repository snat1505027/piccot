{"question": "Lisa is making activity baskets to donate to charity. She has 12 coloring books, 28 markers, and 36 crayons. What is the greatest number of baskets she can make if each type of toy is equally distributed among the baskets?", "qid": "1084", "response": "To find the greatest number of baskets, we need to distribute the toys equally among the baskets. First, we need to find the total number of toys.\n\n12 coloring books + 28 markers + 36 crayons = 76 toys\n\nNext, we need to find the greatest number of baskets that can hold the same number of toys. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of toys in each basket.\n\nThe LCM of 12, 28, and 36 is 288.\n\nNow, we can find the number of baskets that can hold 288 toys. Since 288 is divisible by 28, we can use 28 as the number of toys per basket.\n\n288 toys / 28 toys per basket = 10.14 baskets\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a basket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of baskets.\n\n10.14 baskets rounded up to the nearest whole number = 11 baskets\n\nThe answer is 11 baskets.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1084.png"}
