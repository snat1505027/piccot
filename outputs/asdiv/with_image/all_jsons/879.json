The image shows that Tommy has $79.\n\nNext, we need to find out the cost of the camera and the CD player. The camera costs $35, and the CD player costs $59.\n\nNow, we can add the cost of the camera and the CD player to find out how much money Tommy needs.\n\n$35 + $59 = $94\n\nSince Tommy already has $79, he needs $94 - $79 = $15 more money.\n\nThe answer is $15.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/879.png"}
