{"question": "Two wires with lengths of 448 cm and 616 cm are to be cut into pieces of all the same length without remainder. What is the greatest possible length of the pieces?", "qid": "1871", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest possible length of the pieces by cutting the wires into equal parts.\n\nFirst, we need to find the common multiple of 448 cm and 616 cm. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers is 2.\n\nNext, we can divide both numbers by 2 to find the common multiple:\n448 cm \u00f7 2 = 224 cm\n616 cm \u00f7 2 = 308 cm\n\nNow, we can find the greatest possible length of the pieces by taking the average of the two divided lengths:\n(224 cm + 308 cm) \u00f7 2 = 412 cm\n\nThe answer is 412 cm.", "answer": 56, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1871.png"}
