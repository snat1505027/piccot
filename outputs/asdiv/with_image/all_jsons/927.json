{"question": "Jake set up a candy stand in his front yard. He has 80 pieces of candy to sell. He sold 15 pieces of candy on Monday. He sold much more than that on Tuesday. By Wednesday, Jakes only had 7 pieces left. How many pieces of candy did Jake sell on Tuesday?", "qid": "927", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces of candy Jake sold on Tuesday. We know that he started with 80 pieces of candy and sold 15 pieces on Monday. We also know that he sold more on Tuesday than on Monday, and by Wednesday, he had only 7 pieces left.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of pieces of candy Jake sold on Monday:\n\n80 pieces of candy - 15 pieces sold on Monday = <<80-15=65>>65 pieces of candy left on Monday\n\nNow, we need to find the number of pieces of candy Jake sold on Tuesday. Since he sold more on Tuesday than on Monday, we can assume that he sold all the remaining pieces of candy from Monday, which were 65 pieces.\n\n65 pieces of candy - 65 pieces of candy sold on Tuesday = 0 pieces of candy left on Tuesday\n\nSince Jake sold all the remaining pieces of candy from Monday, he must have sold 65 pieces of candy on Tuesday.\n\nThe answer is 65.", "answer": 58, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/927.png"}
