{"question": "Bob strikes the drums every 9 seconds and the cymbals every 12 seconds. If he just struck both at the same time, how many seconds will pass before he again strikes them at the same time?", "qid": "1857", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total time between both strikes. We can do this by finding the time between drum strikes and the time between cymbal strikes, and then adding them together.\n\n1. Time between drum strikes: 9 seconds\n2. Time between cymbal strikes: 12 seconds\n\nNow, we add the two times together:\n\n9 seconds + 12 seconds = 21 seconds\n\nThe answer is 21 seconds.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1857.png"}
