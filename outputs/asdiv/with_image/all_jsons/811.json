{"question": "I put another number into my machine. The machine added 15 and then subtracted 6. The number 35 came out of the machine. What number did I put in?", "qid": "811", "response": "First, we need to find the number that was put into the machine. Let's call it 'x'.\n\n1. The machine added 15 to the number, so the number that came out is 35.\n2. The machine then subtracted 6 from the number, so the number that came out is 35 - 6 = 31.\n\nSince the number that came out of the machine is 31, we can deduce that the number that was put into the machine was 31 + 6 = 37.\n\nThe answer is 37.", "answer": 26, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/811.png"}
