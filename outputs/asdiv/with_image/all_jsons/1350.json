{"question": "A square garden has a perimeter of 48 meters. A pond inside the garden has an area of 20 square meters. What is the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond?", "qid": "1350", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond. We know that the perimeter of the garden is 48 meters, and the area of the pond is 20 square meters.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length and width of the garden. Let's assume the length of the garden is x meters and the width is y meters. Since the perimeter is 48 meters, we can write the following equation:\n\nx + y + x + y = 48\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y:\n\n2x + 2y = 48\nx + y = 24\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond. The area of the pond is 20 square meters, which means the area of the garden not taken up by the pond is:\n\nArea of the garden = x \\* y - Area of the pond\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of x and y from the previous equations:\n\nArea of the garden = (24 - 20) \\* 24 - 20\nArea of the garden = 4 \\* 24 - 20\nArea of the garden = 96 - 20\nArea of the garden = 76\n\nThe answer is 76 square meters.", "answer": 124, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1350.png"}
