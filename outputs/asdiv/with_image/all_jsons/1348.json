{"question": "Mr. Johnson used 80 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular garden. The length of the garden is 25 meters. How wide is the garden?", "qid": "1348", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the garden. We know that the length of the garden is 25 meters, and Mr. Johnson used 80 meters of fencing to enclose it. We can use the information to set up a proportion equation.\n\nLet's call the width of the garden 'x'. We can write the equation as:\n\nx / 25 = 80 / L\n\nHere, 'L' represents the total length of fencing used, which is 80 meters.\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x' by multiplying both sides by 25:\n\nx = 80 / L \\* 25\n\nSince we know the value of 'L', we can substitute it in the equation:\n\nx = 80 / 80 \\* 25\n\nx = 25\n\nThe width of the garden is 25 meters.\n\nThe answer is 25.", "answer": 15, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1348.png"}
