{"question": "Janice and Jasmine were each given a piece of ribbon of equal length. Janice cuts her ribbons into equal lengths of 2 m, while Jasmine cuts her ribbons into equal lengths of 5 m. If there was no remainder in both cases, what is the shortest possible length of ribbon given to them?", "qid": "1872", "response": "To find the shortest possible length of ribbon given to Janice and Jasmine, we need to find the common length of the ribbons that can be cut into equal lengths of 2 m and 5 m without any remainder.\n\nLet's start by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 5. The LCM of 2 and 5 is 10.\n\nNow, we can divide the 10 by 2 and 5 to find the possible lengths of the ribbons:\n10 / 2 = 5\n10 / 5 = 2\n\nSince both Janice and Jasmine can cut their ribbons into equal lengths of 5 m and 2 m without any remainder, the shortest possible length of ribbon given to them is 5 m.\n\nThe answer is 5 m.", "answer": 10, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1872.png"}
