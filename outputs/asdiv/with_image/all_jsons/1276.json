{"question": "If twice the son's age is added to the father's, the sum is 70. But if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95. Find the ages of father and son.", "qid": "1276", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. We know that twice the son's age is added to the father's age, and the sum is 70. We can represent this as:\n\n2x + 70 = F\n\nNow, we know that twice the father's age is added to the son's age, and the sum is 95. We can represent this as:\n\n2F + 95 = S\n\nSince we have two equations and two unknowns (x and F), we can solve for x and F by using the substitution method. Let's first solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = (70 - F) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n2(70 - F) + 95 = S\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n140 - 2F + 95 = S\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n140 - 2F = S\n\nNow, we can solve for F:\n\n2F = 140 - S\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nF = (140 - S) / 2\n\nNow that we have expressions for both x and F, we can substitute them back into the original equations to find the son's age S:\n\n2(70 - F) + 95 = S\n\n2(70 - (140 - S) / 2) + 95 = S\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2(70 - S) + 95 = S\n\n2S + 95 = 2S + 70\n\n2S = 20\n\nS = 10\n\nNow that we have the son's age, we can find the father's age by substituting the expression for x into the first equation:\n\n2(10) + 70 = F\n\n20 + 70 = F\n\nF = 90\n\nThe answer is: Father's age is 90, and son's age is 10.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1276.png"}
