{"question": "A book store had 4 books in the bargin bin. If they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?", "qid": "1962", "response": "First, we need to find the number of books in the bargain bin after the 3 books were sold. We can do this by subtracting the number of books sold from the initial number of books in the bin.\n\n4 books in the bargain bin - 3 books sold = 1 book left in the bin\n\nNext, we need to find the number of books in the bargain bin after 10 more books were added. We can do this by adding the number of books added to the number of books left in the bin.\n\n1 book left in the bin + 10 more books added = 11 books in the bin\n\nThe answer is 11.", "answer": 11, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1962.png"}
