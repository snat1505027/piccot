{"question": "Carol was sending out birthday invitations to her friends. If each package of invitations she bought had 9 invitations in it and she bought 5 packs, how many friends can she invite?", "qid": "1634", "response": "First, we need to find out how many invitations Carol has in total. She bought 5 packs of invitations, and each pack contains 9 invitations. So, the total number of invitations is 5 packs x 9 invitations per pack = 45 invitations.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many friends Carol can invite. Since we don't know the exact number of friends she has, we can only provide an estimate based on the total number of invitations. If we assume that she has 10 friends, she can invite 45 invitations / 10 friends = 4.5 friends.\n\nHowever, since we cannot invite a fraction of a friend, we can only invite 4 friends.\n\nThe answer is Carol can invite 4 friends.", "answer": 45, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1634.png"}
