{"question": "Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how many 73 cm pieces of ribbon did Sam make?", "qid": "770", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces of ribbon Sam made. We know that Sam cut the ribbon into equal-length pieces, and each piece was 73 cm long. We can use the image to help us find the answer.\n\nIn the image, there is a ruler with the number 3,730 cm marked on it. We can use this ruler to find the number of pieces Sam made. To do this, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece.\n\n3,730 cm \u00f7 73 cm = 50.757142857142857\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a piece, we need to round the number of pieces to the nearest whole number.\n\n50.757142857142857 rounded to the nearest whole number is 51.\n\nThe answer is 51.", "answer": 51, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/770.png"}
