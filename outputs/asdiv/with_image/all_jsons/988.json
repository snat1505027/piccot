{"question": "Karlene read 3 pages on Tuesday, 6 pages on Wednesday, 12 pages on Thursday, 24 pages on Friday, and 48 pages on Saturday. If this pattern continues, how many pages will Karlene read on Sunday?", "qid": "988", "response": "The image shows a pattern of pages read on each day of the week. To determine the number of pages Karlene will read on Sunday, we need to find the pattern in the image.\n\n1. Tuesday: 3 pages\n2. Wednesday: 6 pages\n3. Thursday: 12 pages\n4. Friday: 24 pages\n5. Saturday: 48 pages\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the number of pages read increases by 6 pages each day. To find the number of pages Karlene will read on Sunday, we need to add 6 to the number of pages read on Saturday:\n\n48 + 6 = 54 pages\n\nThe answer is 54 pages.", "answer": 96, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/988.png"}
