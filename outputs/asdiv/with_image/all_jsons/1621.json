{"question": "Haley collected 9 cans for recycling. If she put 7 cans in one bag, how many cans did she have left?", "qid": "1621", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cans Haley had left after putting 7 cans in one bag. We can do this by subtracting the number of cans in one bag from the total number of cans she collected.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of cans in one bag. We know that Haley collected 9 cans, and she put 7 cans in one bag. So, there are 9 - 7 = 2 cans left.\n\nNow, we can find the number of bags Haley needed to collect all the cans. We can do this by dividing the total number of cans by the number of cans in one bag.\n\n9 cans / 7 cans per bag = 1.2857 bags\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of bags.\n\n1.2857 bags rounded up = 2 bags\n\nSo, Haley needed 2 bags to collect all the cans.\n\nThe answer is 2 bags.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1621.png"}
