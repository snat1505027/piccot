{"question": "Mrs. Hilt has a picture frame that is 12 inches high and 10 inches long. What is the perimeter of that picture frame?", "qid": "606", "response": "To find the perimeter of the picture frame, we need to use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nFirst, we need to find the width of the picture frame. The width is given as 10 inches.\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the picture frame. The length is given as 12 inches.\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the perimeter formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\nP = 2(12) + 2(10)\nP = 24 + 20\nP = 44\n\nThe answer is 44.", "answer": 44, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/606.png"}
