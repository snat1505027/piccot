{"question": "Abe is going to plant 54 oak trees and 27 pine trees. Abe would like to plant the trees in rows that all have the same number of trees and are made up of only one type of tree. What is the greatest number of trees Abe can have in each row?", "qid": "1828", "response": "To find the greatest number of trees Abe can have in each row, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 54 and 27.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of 54 and 27:\n\n54 = 2^3 \\* 7\n27 = 3^2 \\* 3\n\nNext, we find the prime factors of the LCM of 54 and 27:\n\nLCM(54, 27) = 2^3 \\* 3^2 \\* 7\n\nNow, we multiply the prime factors to find the LCM:\n\n2^3 \\* 3^2 \\* 7 = 544\n\nThe answer is 544.", "answer": 27, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1828.png"}
