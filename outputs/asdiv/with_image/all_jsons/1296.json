{"question": "A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.", "qid": "1296", "response": "Let's start by analyzing the given information. The man walks a certain distance with a certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. If he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the man's original rate of walking is represented by the distance covered divided by the time taken. The distance covered is represented by the number of boxes, and the time taken is represented by the number of rows.\n\nLet's assume that the man's original rate of walking is represented by the distance covered divided by the time taken, which is 1 box per row. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less, which means the distance covered per row remains the same, but the time taken per row decreases by 1. Similarly, if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours, which means the distance covered per row remains the same, but the time taken per row increases by 3.\n\nNow, let's find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking. Since the distance covered per row is 1 box, we can find the total number of boxes by multiplying the number of rows by the number of boxes per row. The original rate of walking is the total number of boxes divided by the total number of rows.\n\nThe answer is 1 box per row.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1296.png"}
