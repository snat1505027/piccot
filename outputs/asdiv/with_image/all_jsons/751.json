{"question": "There were 44 laptops in the shop, and Mike divided them equally into 5 rows. How many are left?", "qid": "751", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of laptops left in each row after dividing the 44 laptops equally into 5 rows.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of laptops in each row. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of laptops in each row = Total number of laptops / Number of rows\n\nIn this case, the total number of laptops is 44, and the number of rows is 5. So, the number of laptops in each row is:\n\nNumber of laptops in each row = 44 / 5 = 8.8\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a laptop, we need to round the number of laptops in each row to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round 8.8 to 9, which means there are 9 laptops left in each row.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of laptops left in the shop by multiplying the number of laptops in each row by the number of rows:\n\nTotal number of laptops left = Number of laptops in each row x Number of rows\n\nTotal number of laptops left = 9 x 5 = 45\n\nThe answer is 45.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/751.png"}
