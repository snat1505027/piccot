{"question": "In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number.", "qid": "1284", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the two-digit number that meets the given conditions. Let's start by analyzing the problem:\n\n1. The sum of the two digits is 9.\n2. If the digits are reversed, the number is increased by 9.\n\nWe can use the information from the problem to create a system of equations:\n\n1. Let's call the first digit \"x\" and the second digit \"y\".\n2. The sum of x and y is 9, so we can write the equation: x + y = 9.\n3. If the digits are reversed, the new number will be (y + 9)x.\n\nNow, we can substitute the equation for x + y = 9 into the equation for the new number:\n\n(y + 9)x = (9 + x)y\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\ny + 9x = 9y + x\n\nWe can move all the terms to the left side of the equation:\n\n9y + x - 9x = 9y + x\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation further:\n\nx = x\n\nThis equation is true by definition, as we are looking for a two-digit number where the digits are reversed and the number is increased by 9.\n\nThe answer is x = 9.", "answer": 45, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1284.png"}
