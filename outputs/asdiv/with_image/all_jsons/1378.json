{"question": "At the carnival, nine friends bought eight hundred sixty-five tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?", "qid": "1378", "response": "To find the number of tickets each friend would get, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends.\n\n865 tickets \u00f7 9 friends = <<865/9=96.1111>>96.1111 tickets per friend\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a ticket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of tickets per friend.\n\n96.1111 tickets \u00f7 9 friends = 10.6788 tickets per friend\n\nTo round up to the nearest whole number, we add 1 to the result.\n\n10.6788 tickets \u00f7 9 friends = 11 tickets per friend\n\nSince the friends already bought 865 tickets, they would need to buy 11 more tickets to ensure each friend gets the same amount.\n\nThe answer is 11.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1378.png"}
