{"question": "The radio station gave away a $100 bill for every 100th caller. Every 30th caller received free concert tickets. How many callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket?", "qid": "1820", "response": "To find the answer, we need to determine the probability of a caller receiving both a coupon and a concert ticket. We can do this by finding the probability of receiving a coupon and then multiplying it by the probability of receiving a concert ticket.\n\n1. Probability of receiving a coupon:\nThe coupon is awarded every 100th caller. Since the radio station is giving away a $100 bill for every 100th caller, the probability of receiving a coupon is 1/100.\n\n2. Probability of receiving a concert ticket:\nThe concert ticket is awarded every 30th caller. Since the radio station is giving away a concert ticket for every 30th caller, the probability of receiving a concert ticket is 1/30.\n\n3. Probability of receiving both a coupon and a concert ticket:\nTo find the probability of receiving both a coupon and a concert ticket, we need to multiply the probabilities of receiving each item:\n\nProbability of receiving both a coupon and a concert ticket = Probability of receiving a coupon x Probability of receiving a concert ticket\n= 1/100 x 1/30\n= 1/3000\n\nThe answer is 1/3000.", "answer": 300, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1820.png"}
