{"question": "If the second angle is 32 degree less than thrice the first angle and the third angle is 28 degree less than twice the first angle. Find the angles of the triangle.", "qid": "1216", "response": "Let the first angle be x.\n\nThe second angle is 32 degrees less than thrice the first angle, so it is 3x - 32 degrees.\n\nThe third angle is 28 degrees less than twice the first angle, so it is 2x - 28 degrees.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. x + (x - 32) + (x - 28) = 180\n2. 2x - 28 = 180\n3. x - 32 = 180\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n1. x = 180 + 32 + 28 = 230\n2. x = 180 - 28 = 152\n3. x = 180 + 32 = 212\n\nThese are the three possible solutions for the angles of the triangle.\n\nThe answer is x = 180, x = 152, and x = 212.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1216.png"}
