{"question": "Amy was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with one hundred one seeds and planted forty-seven of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put six seeds each. How many small gardens did Amy have?", "qid": "2014", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of small gardens Amy had. We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\nIn the image, there is a square with the number 47 in it, which represents the number of seeds Amy planted in the big garden. There are also two smaller squares, each containing the number 6, which represents the number of seeds Amy planted in each small garden.\n\nTo find the total number of seeds Amy planted, we need to add the number of seeds in the big garden and the number of seeds in each small garden.\n\n47 (seeds in big garden) + 6 (seeds in each small garden) = 53 seeds\n\nSince Amy started with 101 seeds, the number of seeds she planted in her garden is 53.\n\nTo find the number of small gardens, we can use the number of seeds in each small garden, which is 6. We can divide the total number of seeds planted by the number of seeds in each small garden.\n\n53 (total seeds) \u00f7 6 (seeds in each small garden) = 9 small gardens\n\nThe answer is 9 small gardens.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2014.png"}
