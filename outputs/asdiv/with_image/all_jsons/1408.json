{"question": "A new video game console needs five computer chips. If a machine can create four hundred sixty-seven computer chips a day, how many video game consoles can be created in a day?", "qid": "1408", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many video game consoles can be created in a day using the available computer chips.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many computer chips are needed to create one video game console. We know that a new video game console needs five computer chips.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many computer chips can be produced in a day. We know that a machine can create four hundred sixty-seven computer chips a day.\n\nNow, we can find out how many video game consoles can be created in a day by dividing the number of computer chips needed for one console by the number of computer chips produced in a day.\n\nVideo game console per day = 5 computer chips per console / 467 computer chips per day\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to find out how many video game consoles can be created in a day.\n\nVideo game console per day = 5 / 467\n\nVideo game console per day = 0.0109\n\nThe answer is 0.0109 video game consoles per day.", "answer": 93, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1408.png"}
