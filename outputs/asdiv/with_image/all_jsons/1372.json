{"question": "A square traffic sign has a perimeter of 16 feet. How long is each side of the traffic sign?", "qid": "1372", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each side of the square traffic sign. We know that the perimeter of the square is 16 feet. The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.\n\nLet's start by finding the length of one side of the square. We can use the formula for the perimeter of a square: P = 4L, where P is the perimeter, and L is the length of one side.\n\n16 = 4L\n\nNow, we can solve for L:\n\nL = 16 / 4\nL = 4\n\nSince the length of one side is 4 feet, we can find the length of each side by multiplying it by 4.\n\nLength of each side = 4 feet \\* 4 = 16 feet\n\nThe answer is 16 feet.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1372.png"}
