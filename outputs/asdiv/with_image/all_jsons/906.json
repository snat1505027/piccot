{"question": "With flu season coming up, Lexi decides to make get-well-soon kits. She has 10 cans of chicken soup and 15 boxes of tissue, which she wants to use to make identical kits with no materials left over. What is the greatest number of get-well-soon kits Lexi can make?", "qid": "906", "response": "To make identical kits, Lexi needs to use the same number of cans of chicken soup and boxes of tissue in each kit. She has 10 cans of chicken soup and 15 boxes of tissue. To make the greatest number of kits, she should use all the available materials.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of kits that can be made using the 10 cans of chicken soup. Since each kit requires 1 can of chicken soup, Lexi can make 10 kits using the 10 cans.\n\nNext, let's find the maximum number of kits that can be made using the 15 boxes of tissue. Since each kit requires 1 box of tissue, Lexi can make 15 kits using the 15 boxes.\n\nTo find the greatest number of kits Lexi can make, she should combine the maximum number of kits she can make using the chicken soup and tissue. In this case, the greatest number of kits Lexi can make is 10 + 15 = 25.\n\nThe answer is 25.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/906.png"}
