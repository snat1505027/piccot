{"question": "He wanted to make sure that he is protected from the cold evenings in the forest so he decided to build a fireplace made of cement. If he bought 215 lbs of cement and his son brought another 137 lbs, how much cement did he have originally if he now has 450 lbs?", "qid": "328", "response": "First, we need to find the total amount of cement the father initially had. We can do this by adding the amount of cement he bought and the amount his son brought.\n\n215 lbs (father) + 137 lbs (son) = 352 lbs (total)\n\nNow, we know that the father currently has 450 lbs of cement. To find the original amount of cement, we can subtract the current amount from the total amount.\n\n352 lbs (total) - 450 lbs (current) = 98 lbs (missing)\n\nThe answer is 98 lbs.", "answer": 98, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/328.png"}
