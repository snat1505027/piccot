{"question": "An event has 12 adults and 20 children. The event planner wants to make each table identical, with the same combination of adults and children and no people left over. What is the greatest number of tables the planner can set up?", "qid": "914", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest number of tables that can be set up while ensuring that each table has the same combination of adults and children.\n\nLet's start by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 20. The GCD of 12 and 20 is 4.\n\nNow, we can divide the total number of adults (12) and children (20) by 4 to find the number of tables that can be set up.\n\n12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n20 \u00f7 4 = 5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a table, we need to round up the number of tables to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up to 4 tables.\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/914.png"}
