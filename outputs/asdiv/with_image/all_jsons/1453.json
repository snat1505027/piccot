{"question": "A lawn had an area of 20 square feet. If it was 5 feet width, how long was it?", "qid": "1453", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the lawn. We know that the area of the lawn is 20 square feet and the width is 5 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the length.\n\nArea = length x width\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to find the length:\n\nlength = area / width\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nlength = 20 square feet / 5 feet\n\nlength = 4 square feet\n\nSince the length cannot be in square feet, we need to convert it to feet. To do this, we divide the length by 144 (since there are 144 square inches in a square foot).\n\nlength = 4 square feet / 144\n\nlength = 0.02857 feet\n\nThe answer is 0.02857 feet.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1453.png"}
