How many minutes did it take Stanley to get to the top?", "qid": "396", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of minutes it took Stanley to get to the top. We know that it usually takes 30 minutes to get to the top, and Stanley's climb took 7 times longer than usual.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of minutes it took Stanley. We can do this by multiplying the usual time (30 minutes) by the number of times it took longer than usual (7 times).\n\n30 minutes \\* 7 times = 210 minutes\n\nThe answer is 210 minutes.", "answer": 210, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/396.png"}
