So, the total cost of the muffins and fruit cups for Ron is $2 + $2 x 2 = $4.\n\nChanarong had 1 muffin, which costs $2, and 2 fruit cups, which also cost $2 each. So, the total cost of the muffins and fruit cups for Chanarong is $2 + $2 x 2 = $4.\n\nNow, we add the total cost for both Ron and Chanarong to find the total cost of their breakfast. The total cost is $4 + $4 = $8.\n\nThe answer is $8.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/625.png"}
