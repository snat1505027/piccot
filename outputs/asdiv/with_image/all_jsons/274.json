{"question": "Her last stop was the post office. There she sent her rock collection to the Geological Museum in London. She was left with her 15 favorite stones after sending away a part of her collection. If she originally has 78 stones in her collection, how many did she send away?", "qid": "274", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many stones she sent away. We know that she sent away a part of her collection, and she was left with 15 favorite stones. Let's start by finding the number of stones she sent away.\n\n1. We can represent the number of stones she sent away as 'x'.\n2. We know that she sent away a part of her collection, so we can write:\n\n78 - x = 15\n\n3. Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we can add 'x' to both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 78 - 15\n\n4. Now, we can simplify the equation:\n\nx = 63\n\nThe answer is 63.", "answer": 63, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/274.png"}
