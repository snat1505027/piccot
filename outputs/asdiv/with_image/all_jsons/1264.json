{"question": "In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. The vertex angle is twice either base angle. What are the angles of the triangle?", "qid": "1264", "response": "In the image, there are two base angles and a vertex angle. The base angles are equal, and the vertex angle is twice the base angle. Let's denote the base angle as x. The vertex angle would be 2x.\n\nThe image shows that the base angles are equal, so we can write:\nx = 2x/2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nx = x/2\n\nDividing both sides by x, we get:\n1/2 = 1/2x\n\nMultiplying both sides by x, we get:\nx = 1\n\nSo, the base angle is 1, and the vertex angle is 2. The angles of the isosceles triangle are 1 and 2.\n\nThe answer is 1 and 2.", "answer": 45, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1264.png"}
