We can start by finding the number of bags and the number of cans per bag.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that there are four bags, and each bag contains five cans. So, the number of cans per bag is five.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of cans. To do this, we can multiply the number of bags by the number of cans per bag.\n\n4 bags x 5 cans per bag = 20 cans\n\nThe answer is 20 cans.", "answer": 20, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1556.png"}
