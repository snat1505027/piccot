{"question": "A parking lot has 35 empty space. If the ratio of empty spaces to taken spaces is 5:4, how many spaces are there total?", "qid": "1506", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of spaces in the parking lot. We know that there are 35 empty spaces and the ratio of empty spaces to taken spaces is 5:4. This means that for every 5 empty spaces, there are 4 taken spaces.\n\nTo find the total number of spaces, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Multiply the number of empty spaces by 5 to find the total number of empty spaces.\n35 empty spaces \\* 5 = 175 empty spaces\n\n2. Multiply the number of empty spaces by 4 to find the total number of taken spaces.\n175 empty spaces \\* 4 = 700 taken spaces\n\n3. Add the total number of empty spaces and taken spaces to find the total number of spaces.\n175 empty spaces + 700 taken spaces = 875 total spaces\n\nThe answer is 875.", "answer": 63, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1506.png"}
