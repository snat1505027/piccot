We can do this by multiplying the number of crowns by the number of feathers per crown.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of feathers per crown. The image shows that each crown is made with 7 different colored feathers.\n\nNext, we need to multiply the number of crowns by the number of feathers per crown. In this case, we need to multiply 934 by 7.\n\nFinally, we can find the total number of feathers needed by multiplying the result of the previous step by 7.\n\nThe answer is 6548 feathers.", "answer": 6538, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/429.png"}
