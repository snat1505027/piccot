{"question": "Jasmine and her mom went to the grocery to buy some food. Her mom gave her $100.00 to spend. Since she loves fruits, she went to the fruits section first. There she bought apples and oranges worth $15.00. From the original $100.00 given by her mom, how much money was left for her to spend?", "qid": "275", "response": "First, we need to find out how much money was spent on apples and oranges. We know that the total cost of apples and oranges is $15.00. We can find the cost of each fruit by dividing the total cost by the number of fruits.\n\n$15.00 / 2 fruits = $<<15.00/2=7.50>>7.50 per fruit\n\nSince Jasmine bought 2 fruits, the total cost of the fruits is $7.50 x 2 = $<<7.50*2=15.00>>15.00.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cost of the fruits from the original amount given by her mom.\n\n$100.00 - $15.00 = $<<100.00-15.00=85.00>>85.00\n\nThe answer is $85.00.", "answer": 85, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/275.png"}
