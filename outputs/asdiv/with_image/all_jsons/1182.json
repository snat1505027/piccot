{"question": "The ages of Ashley and Mary are in the ratio 4:7. The sum of their ages is 22. Find the ages of Ashley and Mary.", "qid": "1182", "response": "First, we need to find the age of one of the girls. Let's assume that Ashley's age is 4x.\n\nFrom the image, we know that the sum of their ages is 22. So, we can write:\n\n4x + 7x = 22\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by adding 4x to both sides:\n\n11x = 22\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by 11 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 22 \u00f7 11\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the age of Ashley:\n\nAshley's age = 4x = 4 \\* 2 = 8\n\nThe age of Mary is 7x, so her age is:\n\nMary's age = 7x = 7 \\* 2 = 14\n\nThe answer is Ashley is 8 years old and Mary is 14 years old.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1182.png"}
