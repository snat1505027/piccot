{"question": "There are 397 butterflies. Each butterfly has 12 black dots and 17 yellow dots. How many black dots are there in all?", "qid": "513", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of black dots on all the butterflies.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of dots on all the butterflies. There are 397 butterflies, and each butterfly has 12 black dots and 17 yellow dots. So, the total number of dots on all the butterflies is:\n\n397 butterflies \\* 12 black dots per butterfly + 397 butterflies \\* 17 yellow dots per butterfly = 4764 black dots + 7138 yellow dots\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of black dots. We can do this by subtracting the number of yellow dots from the total number of dots:\n\n4764 black dots + 7138 yellow dots - 7138 yellow dots = 4764 black dots\n\nThe answer is 4764.", "answer": 4764, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/513.png"}
