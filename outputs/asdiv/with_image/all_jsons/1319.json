{"question": "Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.", "qid": "1319", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of the angles in the triangle. We know that two angles are the same size, so we can call one of them x. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle, so it is x - 12.\n\nWe can represent this information in the form of an equation:\n\nx - 12 = 12\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx = 24\n\nSo, the measure of the first angle is 24 degrees. The measure of the second angle is also 24 degrees. The measure of the third angle is 24 - 12 = 12 degrees.\n\nThe answer is:\n\nThe first angle is 24 degrees, the second angle is also 24 degrees, and the third angle is 12 degrees.", "answer": 64, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1319.png"}
