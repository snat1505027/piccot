{"question": "Karen is packing equal quantities of pretzels and crackers for snacks. Karen bags the pretzels in groups of 5 and the crackers in groups of 7. What is the smallest number of crackers that she can pack?", "qid": "1106", "response": "To find the smallest number of crackers, we need to find the smallest multiple of 7 that is less than or equal to the smallest multiple of 5.\n\nThe smallest multiple of 5 is 5, and the smallest multiple of 7 is 7. Since 5 is less than 7, we can pack the smallest number of crackers by packing 5 groups of 7 crackers each.\n\nThe smallest number of crackers is 5 x 7 = 35.\n\nThe answer is 35.", "answer": 35, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1106.png"}
