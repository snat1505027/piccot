We know that it takes 4 feet of cotton to make a tee-shirt.\n\nFirst, we need to convert 60 feet of material into tee-shirts. To do this, we can divide 60 by 4, which gives us 15 tee-shirts.\n\nHowever, the image also shows a question mark, which indicates that there might be an error in the calculation. Therefore, we cannot be certain about the answer.\n\nThe answer is 15 tee-shirts.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/547.png"}
