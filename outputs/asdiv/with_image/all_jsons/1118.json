{"question": "An art museum had 15 pictures to split equally into 2 different exhibits. How many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount?", "qid": "1118", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pictures that would make the two exhibits have the same amount. Let's start by finding the average number of pictures per exhibit.\n\n15 pictures / 2 exhibits = 7.5 pictures per exhibit\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a picture, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n7.5 pictures per exhibit rounded up to the nearest whole number is 8 pictures per exhibit.\n\nTo find the number of pictures they would need to make sure each exhibit has the same amount, we need to subtract the current number of pictures per exhibit (8) from the desired number of pictures per exhibit (8).\n\n8 pictures per exhibit - 8 pictures per exhibit = 0 pictures needed.\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 1, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1118.png"}
