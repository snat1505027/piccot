{"question": "At the river, 25 out of 55 salmon families went to warmer waters to avoid being frozen. How many salmon families were left in the river?", "qid": "261", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of salmon families that were left in the river. We know that 25 out of 55 salmon families went to warmer waters, so we can find the number of families left in the river by subtracting 25 from 55.\n\n25 out of 55 = 25/55\n\nTo find the number of families left in the river, we can multiply the fraction by the total number of families:\n\n25/55 \\* 55 = 25 \\* 55 = 1425\n\nTherefore, 1425 salmon families were left in the river.\n\nThe answer is 1425.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/261.png"}
