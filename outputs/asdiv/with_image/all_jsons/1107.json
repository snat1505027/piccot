{"question": "Irene's Bakery sells muffins in packages of 18 and cookies in packages of 5. Going through yesterday's receipts, a store manager notices that the bakery sold the same number of muffins and cookies yesterday afternoon. What is the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold?", "qid": "1107", "response": "To find the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold, we need to find the smallest number of cookies that the bakery could have sold. Since the store manager notices that the bakery sold the same number of muffins and cookies yesterday afternoon, we can find the smallest number of cookies by looking at the smallest number of muffins.\n\nThe smallest number of muffins is 18, as it is the smallest number of muffins that the bakery sells in a package. To find the smallest number of cookies, we can divide 18 by 5, which is the number of cookies in a package. 18 \u00f7 5 = 3.6. Since cookies cannot be sold in a fraction, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. The smallest number of cookies that the bakery could have sold is 4.\n\nThe smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold is 18. The smallest number of cookies that the bakery could have sold is 4.", "answer": 90, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1107.png"}
