{"question": "John is building a tree house to serve as his hideout whenever he wanted to spend some time alone with himself. The first thing he did is to gather some materials. For the pillars, he needs two sets of wood with different lengths. If the first set of wood is 4 feet long and the second set is 5 times longer than the first set, how long is the second set of wood?", "qid": "360", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the second set of wood. We know that the first set of wood is 4 feet long, and the second set is 5 times longer than the first set.\n\nLet's start by setting up a proportion equation:\n\nLet x be the length of the second set of wood.\n\nWe can write the equation as:\n\nx = 4 \\* 5\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 4 \\* 5 = 20\n\nThe second set of wood is 20 feet long.\n\nThe answer is 20.", "answer": 20, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/360.png"}
