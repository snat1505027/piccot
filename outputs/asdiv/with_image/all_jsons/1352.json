{"question": "A square has sides that measure 15 cm. A rectangle has a length of 18 cm. The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. What is the area of the rectangle?", "qid": "1352", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the rectangle. We know that the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle, so we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.\n\nFirst, we need to find the width of the rectangle. We can do this by dividing the perimeter by 2, since there are two sides that contribute to the perimeter. P = 2L + 2W, so 2L + 2W = P.\n\nNext, we can substitute the value of P from the problem statement: 15 cm. 2L + 2W = 15 cm.\n\nNow, we can solve for W: 2L + 2W = 15 cm\n2L = 15 cm - 2W\n2L = 13 cm\nL = 13 cm / 2\nL = 6.5 cm\n\nNow that we have the length and width of the rectangle, we can find the area. The area of a rectangle is calculated as A = L x W.\n\nA = 6.5 cm x W\n\nTo find the width, we can substitute the value of L from the previous step:\n\nA = 6.5 cm x W\nW = A / 6.5 cm\n\nFinally, we can solve for W:\n\nW = A / 6.5 cm\nW = 13 cm^2 / 6.5 cm\nW = 2 cm\n\nThe answer is 2 cm.", "answer": 216, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1352.png"}
