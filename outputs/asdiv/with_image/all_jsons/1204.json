{"question": "The area of trapezium is 84 Sq.cm and height is 8 cm. The parallel sides are in the ratio 2:5. Find the length of the bases.", "qid": "1204", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the bases of the trapezium. We can start by using the given information:\n\n1. Area of the trapezium = 84 square centimeters (sq.cm)\n2. Height of the trapezium = 8 centimeters (cm)\n3. Parallel sides are in the ratio 2:5\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the base of the trapezium. We can use the formula for the area of a trapezium:\n\nArea = (1/2) \\* (base1 + base2) \\* height\n\nGiven the area of the trapezium, we can write:\n\n84 = (1/2) \\* (base1 + base2) \\* 8\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of the base:\n\n84 = (1/2) \\* (base1 + base2) \\* 8\n\n84 = (1/2) \\* (base1 + base2)\n\n84 = base1 + base2\n\nSince the parallel sides are in the ratio 2:5, we can find the length of the base1 by dividing the height by 5:\n\nbase1 = 8 / 5 = 1.6 cm\n\nNow, we can find the length of the base2 by adding the length of base1 to itself:\n\nbase2 = 1.6 + 1.6 = 3.2 cm\n\nThe answer is 1.6 cm and 3.2 cm.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1204.png"}
