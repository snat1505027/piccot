{"question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?", "qid": "2048", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost for the group to eat. We know that each adult meal costs $8, and there are 9 adults in the group. So, the total cost for the adults would be 9 x $8 = $<<9*8=72>>72.\n\nSince there are 2 kids in the group, they eat for free. So, the total cost for the group to eat would be $72 + the cost for the kids' meals. Since the kids eat for free, the cost for the kids' meals would be $0.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be $72 + $0 = $<<72+0=72>>72.\n\nThe answer is $72.", "answer": 72, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2048.png"}
