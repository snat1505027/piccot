{"question": "The weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. The total weight of 5 such bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?", "qid": "790", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight difference between a bag of chips and a bottle of juice.\n\nFirst, we need to find the weight of one bag of chips and one bottle of juice.\n\nThe weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g, so the weight of one bag of chips is 800 g / 2 = 400 g.\n\nThe weight of 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g, so the weight of one bottle of juice is 2 kg 200 g / 4 = 500 g.\n\nNow, we can find the weight difference between a bag of chips and a bottle of juice:\n\nWeight difference = weight of a bag of chips - weight of a bottle of juice\nWeight difference = 400 g - 500 g\nWeight difference = -100 g\n\nThe answer is -100 g.", "answer": 350, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/790.png"}
