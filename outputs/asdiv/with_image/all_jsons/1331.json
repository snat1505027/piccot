{"question": "Jamal and Moshe began a business with a capital of $7500. If Jamal furnished half as much capital as Moshe, how much did each furnish?", "qid": "1331", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of capital furnished by each partner. Let's start by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. The capital is $7500.\n2. Jamal furnished half as much capital as Moshe.\n\nTo find the amount of capital furnished by Moshe, we can divide the total capital by 2.\n\n$7500 / 2 = $3750\n\nNow that we know the amount of capital furnished by Moshe, we can find the amount furnished by Jamal by multiplying the total capital by the fraction of capital furnished by Jamal.\n\n$7500 \\* (1/2) = $3750\n\nSince the answer is the same as the amount of capital furnished by Moshe, we can conclude that both Jamal and Moshe furnished $3750 each.\n\nThe answer is $3750.", "answer": 2500, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1331.png"}
