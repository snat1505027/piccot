{"question": "The angles of a triangle are in the ratio 1:2:3. Find each angle of the triangle.", "qid": "1215", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the given information that the angles of the triangle are in the ratio 1:2:3. We can start by dividing the triangle into three equal parts, with each part representing one of the angles.\n\n1. First, we can find the smallest angle, which is 1/3 of the triangle. To find this angle, we can multiply the triangle's side length by 1/3.\n\nSide length of the triangle = 3\n1/3 of the triangle = 3/3 = 1\n\n2. Next, we can find the second-largest angle, which is 2/3 of the triangle. To find this angle, we can multiply the triangle's side length by 2/3.\n\nSide length of the triangle = 3\n2/3 of the triangle = 2/3 \\* 3 = 2\n\n3. Finally, we can find the largest angle, which is 1/2 of the triangle. To find this angle, we can multiply the triangle's side length by 1/2.\n\nSide length of the triangle = 3\n1/2 of the triangle = 1/2 \\* 3 = 1.5\n\nThe answer is:\n\n1. The smallest angle is 1.\n2. The second-largest angle is 2.\n3. The largest angle is 1.5.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1215.png"}
