{"question": "Derek is picking flowers in the garden. He picked 18 flowers from the first bush, 22 flowers from the second bush, 26 flowers from the third bush, 30 flowers from the fourth bush, and 34 flowers from the fifth bush. If this pattern continues, how many flowers will Derek pick from the sixth bush?", "qid": "984", "response": "To find the number of flowers Derek will pick from the sixth bush, we need to find the pattern in the given numbers. The pattern is that Derek picks 2 more flowers from each subsequent bush than the previous one.\n\n18 + 2 = 20\n22 + 2 = 24\n26 + 2 = 28\n30 + 2 = 32\n34 + 2 = 36\n\nThe pattern continues, so we can predict that Derek will pick 36 flowers from the sixth bush.\n\nThe answer is 36.", "answer": 38, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/984.png"}
