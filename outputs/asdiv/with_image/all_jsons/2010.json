{"question": "Kaleb was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled five bags up and on Sunday he filled five more bags. If each bag had four cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total?", "qid": "2010", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cans collected by Kaleb.\n\nOn Saturday, he filled five bags with four cans each, so the total number of cans collected on Saturday is 5 bags x 4 cans per bag = 20 cans.\n\nOn Sunday, he filled five more bags with four cans each, so the total number of cans collected on Sunday is 5 bags x 4 cans per bag = 20 cans.\n\nThe total number of cans collected is the sum of the cans collected on Saturday and Sunday, which is 20 cans + 20 cans = 40 cans.\n\nThe answer is 40 cans.", "answer": 40, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2010.png"}
