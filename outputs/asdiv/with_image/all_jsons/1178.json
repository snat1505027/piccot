{"question": "Mrs. Smith is 8 years more than twice the age of her son. The ages of son is 12. Find the age of mother and find the difference between their ages.", "qid": "1178", "response": "The image shows a series of equations with the age of a son, age of a mother, and the difference in their ages. The age of the son is 12, and the difference in their ages is 8.\n\nLet's start by finding the age of the mother. We know that Mrs. Smith is 8 years more than twice the age of her son. So, we can write the equation:\n\nAge of mother = 2 x Age of son + 8\n\nNow, we can substitute the age of the son, which is 12, into the equation:\n\nAge of mother = 2 x 12 + 8\n\nAge of mother = 24 + 8\n\nAge of mother = 32\n\nNow, we can find the difference in their ages by subtracting the age of the son from the age of the mother:\n\nDifference in their ages = Age of mother - Age of son\n\nDifference in their ages = 32 - 12\n\nDifference in their ages = 20\n\nThe answer is 20.", "answer": 32, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1178.png"}
