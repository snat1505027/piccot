{"question": "Kristen found gift bags in packs of 12 and bows in packs of 5. If Kristen wanted to have the same number of gift bags as bows, what is the smallest number of gift bags she would have to buy?", "qid": "1844", "response": "To find the smallest number of gift bags Kristen would have to buy, we need to find the smallest number that can be divided evenly by both 12 and 5. We can do this by finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12 and 5.\n\nThe LCM of 12 and 5 is 60.\n\nTo find the smallest number of gift bags, we can divide 60 by 12 and 5:\n\n60 \u00f7 12 = 5\n60 \u00f7 5 = 12\n\nThe smallest number of gift bags Kristen would have to buy is 5.\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 60, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1844.png"}
