{"question": "Mrs. Hilt bought carnival tickets. The tickets cost $1 for 4 tickets. If Mrs. Hilt bought 12 tickets, how much did she pay?", "qid": "155", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the tickets Mrs. Hilt bought. We know that the cost of each ticket is $1, and she bought 12 tickets.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of tickets she bought in terms of the cost per ticket. We can do this by dividing the total number of tickets by the cost per ticket:\n\n12 tickets \u00f7 $1 per ticket = 12 \u00f7 1 = 12 tickets\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of the tickets by multiplying the number of tickets by the cost per ticket:\n\n12 tickets \u00d7 $1 per ticket = 12 \u00d7 1 = 12\n\nThe total cost of the tickets is $12.\n\nThe answer is $12.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/155.png"}
