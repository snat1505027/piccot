{"question": "I am three times as old as my son. Five years later, I shall be two and a half times as old as my son. How old am I and how old is my son?", "qid": "1277", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. We know that I am three times as old as my son, so we can write that as:\n\nI = 3S\n\nWe also know that five years later, I will be two and a half times as old as my son, so we can write that as:\n\nI + 5 = 2.5S + 5\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get:\n\n3S + 5 = 2.5S + 5\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3S = 2S + 5\n\nSubtracting 2S from both sides, we get:\n\nS = 5\n\nNow that we know the son's age is 5, we can substitute that value back into the first equation to find the father's age:\n\nI = 3S\n\nI = 3 \\* 5\n\nI = 15\n\nThe answer is I am 15 years old and my son is 5 years old.", "answer": 45, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1277.png"}
