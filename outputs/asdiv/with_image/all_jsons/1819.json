{"question": "Sean has 8-inch pieces of toy train track and Ruth has 18-inch pieces of train track. How many of each piece would each child need to build tracks that are equal in length?", "qid": "1819", "response": "To build tracks that are equal in length, we need to find the number of Sean's 8-inch pieces and Ruth's 18-inch pieces that are needed.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total length of the tracks that both children need. Since the tracks are equal in length, we can find the total length by adding the length of Sean's 8-inch pieces and Ruth's 18-inch pieces.\n\n8 inches + 18 inches = 26 inches\n\nNow, we need to find the number of Sean's 8-inch pieces and Ruth's 18-inch pieces that are needed to build tracks of 26 inches in length.\n\nTo find the number of Sean's 8-inch pieces, we can divide the total length by the length of each piece:\n\n26 inches \u00f7 8 inches = 3.25\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a piece, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of Sean's 8-inch pieces.\n\n3.25 pieces \u2248 4 pieces\n\nTo find the number of Ruth's 18-inch pieces, we can divide the total length by the length of each piece:\n\n26 inches \u00f7 18 inches = 1.44\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a piece, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of Ruth's 18-inch pieces.\n\n1.44 pieces \u2248 2 pieces\n\nTherefore, Sean would need 4 pieces of 8-inch toy train track, and Ruth would need 2 pieces of 18-inch toy train track to build tracks that are equal in length.\n\nThe answer is 4 pieces of 8-inch toy train track and 2 pieces of 18-inch toy train track.", "answer": 72, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1819.png"}
