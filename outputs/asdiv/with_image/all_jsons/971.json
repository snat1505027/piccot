{"question": "The difference between two numbers is 24. The smaller number is 46. What is the larger number?", "qid": "971", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the larger number. We know that the difference between the two numbers is 24, and the smaller number is 46. Let's start by finding the larger number.\n\n1. First, we need to find the sum of the two numbers. We can do this by adding the smaller number and the difference between them.\n\n46 + 24 = 70\n\n2. Now, we have the sum of the two numbers, which is 70. We can find the larger number by subtracting the smaller number from the sum.\n\n70 - 46 = 24\n\n3. We have found that the larger number is 24. The answer is 24.", "answer": 70, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/971.png"}
