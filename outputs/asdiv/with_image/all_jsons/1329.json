{"question": "Aaron had 7 times as many sheep as Beth, and both together had 608. How many sheep had each?", "qid": "1329", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. Aaron had 7 times as many sheep as Beth. We can represent this as 7x.\n\nNext, we know that both Aaron and Beth together had 608 sheep. We can represent this as 7x + 608.\n\nNow, we need to solve for the number of sheep each person had. To do this, we can divide the total number of sheep by the number of people. In this case, we have 7x + 608, and we need to divide by 2 to find the number of sheep each person had.\n\n7x + 608 \u00f7 2 = 354 sheep per person\n\nSince we know that Aaron had 7 times as many sheep as Beth, we can multiply the number of sheep per person by 7 to find the number of sheep Aaron had.\n\n354 sheep per person \u00d7 7 = 2488 sheep\n\nThe answer is 2488 sheep.", "answer": 76, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1329.png"}
