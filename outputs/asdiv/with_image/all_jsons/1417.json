{"question": "A school had nine hundred thirty-five students sign up for the trivia teams. If they wanted to have six team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?", "qid": "1417", "response": "To find the number of students needed to sign up, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of teams.\n\n935 students / 6 teams = 156 students per team\n\nSince we want the same number of students on each team, we need to add the same number of students to the total number of students.\n\n156 students per team + 156 students per team = 312 students per team\n\nTo find the total number of students needed, we multiply the number of teams by the number of students per team.\n\n6 teams x 312 students per team = 1872 students needed to sign up\n\nThe answer is 1872.", "answer": 1, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1417.png"}
