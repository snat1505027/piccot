{"question": "Laverne has 20 baseballs and 15 basketballs. If she wants to divide them into identical groups without any balls left over, what is the greatest number of groups Laverne can make?", "qid": "1069", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 15. The GCD of 20 and 15 is 5.\n\nLaverne can divide the baseballs and basketballs into groups of 5 without any balls left over.\n\nNumber of baseballs: 20\nNumber of basketballs: 15\n\nTo find the total number of balls, we add the number of baseballs and basketballs:\n\n20 + 15 = 35\n\nTo find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of balls by the number of balls in each group:\n\n35 / 5 = 7\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1069.png"}
