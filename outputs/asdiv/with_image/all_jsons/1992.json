{"question": "For Halloween Isabel received sixteen pieces of candy from neighbors and five pieces from her older sister. If she only ate three pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?", "qid": "1992", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days the candy will last Isabel if she eats three pieces a day.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy Isabel received. We can do this by adding the number of pieces she received from neighbors and her older sister.\n\n16 (neighbors) + 5 (older sister) = 21\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pieces of candy Isabel has in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of pieces she received by the number of days she will eat the candy.\n\n21 (candy) \u00d7 3 (days) = 63\n\nSince Isabel received 21 pieces of candy and will eat 3 pieces a day, the candy will last her for 63 days.\n\nThe answer is 63.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1992.png"}
