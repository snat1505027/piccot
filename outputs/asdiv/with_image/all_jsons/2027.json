{"question": "Faye's team won their baseball game and scored sixty-eight points total. If Faye scored twenty-eight of the points and everyone else scored eight points each, how many players were on her team?", "qid": "2027", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of players on Faye's team. We know that Faye scored twenty-eight points, and everyone else scored eight points each. We can use the information provided in the image to find the total number of points scored by the team.\n\nTotal points scored by the team = Faye's points + points scored by everyone else\nTotal points scored by the team = 28 + 8 \\* (number of players on the team)\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the number of players on the team:\n\nNumber of players on the team = Total points scored by the team / (Faye's points + 8)\n\nNumber of players on the team = 68 / (28 + 8)\n\nNumber of players on the team = 68 / 36\n\nNumber of players on the team = 1.94\n\nSince the number of players on the team must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, there are two players on Faye's team.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2027.png"}
