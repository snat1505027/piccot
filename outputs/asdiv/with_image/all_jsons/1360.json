{"question": "The ratio of the area of a rectangle to the area of a triangle is 2:5. The rectangle has a length of 6 cm and a width of 4 cm. What is the area of the triangle?", "qid": "1360", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the triangle. We know that the ratio of the area of the rectangle to the area of the triangle is 2:5. Let's start by finding the area of the rectangle.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. In this case, the length is 6 cm and the width is 4 cm.\n\nArea of rectangle = length x width\nArea of rectangle = 6 cm x 4 cm\nArea of rectangle = 24 cm\u00b2\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the triangle. Since the ratio of the area of the rectangle to the area of the triangle is 2:5, we can find the area of the triangle by dividing the area of the rectangle by 5.\n\nArea of triangle = Area of rectangle / 5\nArea of triangle = 24 cm\u00b2 / 5\nArea of triangle = 4.8 cm\u00b2\n\nThe answer is 4.8 cm\u00b2.", "answer": 60, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1360.png"}
