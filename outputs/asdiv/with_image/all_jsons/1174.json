{"question": "Ana is 5 years more than Jack. The sum of their ages is 29. Find the ages of Ana and Jack.", "qid": "1174", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the image. Ana is 5 years older than Jack, so we can write:\n\nAna's age = Jack's age + 5\n\nThe sum of their ages is 29, so we can write:\n\nAna's age + Jack's age = 29\n\nNow we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:\n\n(Jack's age + 5) + Jack's age = 29\n\n2 Jack's age + 5 = 29\n\nNow we can solve for Jack's age:\n\n2 Jack's age = 29 - 5\n\nJack's age = (29 - 5) / 2\n\nJack's age = 24\n\nNow that we know Jack's age, we can find Ana's age:\n\nAna's age = Jack's age + 5\n\nAna's age = 24 + 5\n\nAna's age = 29\n\nThe answer is Ana is 29 years old and Jack is 24 years old.", "answer": 17, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1174.png"}
