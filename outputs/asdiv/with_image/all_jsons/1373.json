{"question": "Each side of a square piece of sheet metal is 7 meters long. What is the sheet metal's perimeter?", "qid": "1373", "response": "To find the perimeter of the sheet metal, we need to use the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length of a side, and W is the width of the sheet metal. Since the sheet metal is square, the width is equal to the length.\n\nIn this case, the length of each side is 7 meters, so the width is also 7 meters. To find the perimeter, we need to add the length and width together twice, which gives us:\n\nP = 2(7) + 2(7) = 14 + 14 = 28 meters\n\nThe answer is 28 meters.", "answer": 28, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1373.png"}
