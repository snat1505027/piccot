{"question": "Joe, Susie's brother, collected all 94 trading cards scattered in his room and placed them in boxes. If a full box can hold a maximum of 8 cards, how many boxes were fully filled?", "qid": "478", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of full boxes. First, we need to calculate the total number of cards in the 94 trading cards. Since a full box can hold a maximum of 8 cards, we can divide the total number of cards by 8 to find the number of full boxes.\n\n94 cards \u00f7 8 cards per full box = <<94/8=11.75>>11.75 full boxes\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a full box, we need to round up to the nearest full box. Therefore, we have 12 full boxes.\n\nThe answer is 12 full boxes.", "answer": 11, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/478.png"}
