{"question": "Luke was putting his spare change into piles. He had five piles of quarters and five piles of dimes. If each pile had three coins in it, how many coins did he have total?", "qid": "2001", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of coins in the piles of quarters. There are five piles of quarters, and each pile has three coins in it. So, the total number of coins in the piles of quarters is 5 x 3 = 15.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of coins in the piles of dimes. There are five piles of dimes, and each pile has three coins in it. So, the total number of coins in the piles of dimes is 5 x 3 = 15.\n\nNow, we add the total number of coins in the piles of quarters and dimes to find the total number of coins. The total number of coins is 15 + 15 = 30.\n\nThe answer is 30.", "answer": 30, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2001.png"}
