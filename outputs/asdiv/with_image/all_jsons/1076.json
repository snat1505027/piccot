What is the greatest number of tables the band can sell shirts from?", "qid": "1076", "response": "To find the greatest number of tables the band can sell shirts from, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 8. The GCD of 20 and 8 is 2.\n\nThe band can set up 2 tables, each with 10 men's T-shirts and 4 women's T-shirts. This way, the band can sell shirts without leaving any shirts over.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1076.png"}
