{"question": "A pet store sold 12 siamese cats. If the ratio of siamese cats to house cats sold was 2:1, what is the combined amount of cats sold?", "qid": "1516", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of house cats sold. We know that the ratio of siamese cats to house cats is 2:1, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n12 siamese cats / 2 house cats = 12 house cats\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of house cats:\n\n12 siamese cats / 2 = 12 house cats\n\n12 siamese cats = 24 house cats\n\nSince we know that there are 12 siamese cats, we can find the number of house cats by dividing 12 by 2:\n\n12 house cats = 12 siamese cats / 2\n\nNow, we can find the combined amount of cats sold by adding the number of siamese cats and house cats:\n\n12 siamese cats + 12 house cats = 24 cats\n\nThe answer is 24 cats.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1516.png"}
