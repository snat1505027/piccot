{"question": "A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?", "qid": "773", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of rooms needed for the tourist group. We can do this by first finding the total number of people in the group and then dividing that number by the number of people per room.\n\n26 people / 3 people per large room = 8.67 large rooms needed\n26 people / 2 people per small room = 13.25 small rooms needed\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a room, we need to round up the number of small rooms to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need 14 small rooms.\n\nThe answer is 14 small rooms.", "answer": 1, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/773.png"}
