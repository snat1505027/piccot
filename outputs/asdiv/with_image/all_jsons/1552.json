{"question": "The roller coaster at the state fair costs five tickets per ride. If you had ten tickets, how many times could you ride it?", "qid": "1552", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times you can ride the roller coaster with ten tickets. The image shows that the roller coaster costs five tickets per ride.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of tickets required for one ride. We can do this by dividing the cost of the roller coaster by the number of tickets per ride:\n\n5 tickets per ride / 5 tickets = 1 ride\n\nNext, we need to find the number of rides we can have with ten tickets. We can do this by dividing the number of tickets by the number of tickets per ride:\n\n10 tickets / 5 tickets per ride = 2 rides\n\nHowever, the image also shows a question mark, which indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement. The correct answer is not 2 rides, but rather 10 rides, as the roller coaster costs five tickets per ride.\n\nThe answer is 10 rides.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1552.png"}
