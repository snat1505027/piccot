{"question": "A man bought a cow and a calf for $990, paying 8 times as much for the cow as for the calf. What was the cost of each?", "qid": "1330", "response": "The man bought a cow and a calf for $990. The cost of the cow is 8 times the cost of the calf. Let's call the cost of the calf x.\n\nThe cost of the cow is 8x.\n\nThe total cost of both the cow and the calf is $990.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent this:\n\n8x + x = 990\n\nNow, we can solve the equation by adding 8x and x together:\n\n9x = 990\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\nx = 109.44\n\nSince the cost of the calf is $109.44, the cost of the cow is 8 times that amount:\n\nCost of cow = 8 x $109.44 = $875.52\n\nThe answer is $875.52 for the cow and $109.44 for the calf.", "answer": 110, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1330.png"}
