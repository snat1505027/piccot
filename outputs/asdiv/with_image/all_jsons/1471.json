{"question": "An island in the Pacific Ocean was 5 miles wide. It had a total area of 50 square miles. How long is the island?", "qid": "1471", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the island. We know that the island is 5 miles wide and has a total area of 50 square miles. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the length of the island.\n\nArea = length x width\n\nSince the width is given as 5 miles, we can plug that into the formula.\n\n50 = length x 5\n\nNow, we need to solve for the length. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5.\n\nlength = 50 / 5\n\nlength = 10\n\nThe answer is 10 miles.", "answer": 10, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1471.png"}
