How many more coints of the total than quarts does Trevor have?", "qid": "916", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of coins Trevor has and the number of quarters he has.\n\n1. Total coins = 77\n2. Quarters = 29\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of dimes Trevor has. Since he has 77 coins and 29 quarters, the remaining coins must be dimes.\n\n1. Total dimes = 77 - 29 = 48\n\nTo find the difference between the total number of coins and the number of quarters, we can simply subtract the number of quarters from the total number of coins.\n\n1. Difference = 77 - 29 = 48\n\nThe answer is 48.", "answer": 48, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/916.png"}
