{"question": "Two bikers are riding a circular path. The first rider completes a round in 12 minutes. The second rider completes a round in 18 minutes. If they both started at the same place and time and go in the same direction, after how many minutes will they meet again at the starting point?", "qid": "1818", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in time between the two riders and then divide it by the time it takes for one rider to complete a round.\n\nFirst, we need to find the time it takes for the second rider to complete a round. We can do this by dividing the number of minutes it takes for the first rider to complete a round by 2, since the second rider is going at half the speed.\n\n12 minutes / 2 = 6 minutes\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in time between the two riders. We can do this by subtracting the time it takes for the first rider to complete a round from the time it takes for the second rider to complete a round.\n\n6 minutes - 12 minutes = -6 minutes\n\nSince the second rider is going in the same direction as the first rider, we need to add the negative time to the time it takes for the first rider to complete a round.\n\n12 minutes + (-6 minutes) = 6 minutes\n\nNow, we can divide the difference in time by the time it takes for one rider to complete a round to find the number of minutes it takes for the two riders to meet again at the starting point.\n\n6 minutes / 12 minutes = 0.5 minutes\n\nThe answer is 0.5 minutes.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1818.png"}
