{"question": "A full moon occurs every 30 days. If the last full moon occurred on a Friday, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday?", "qid": "808", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days between two full moons. Since a full moon occurs every 30 days, we can find the number of days between two full moons by dividing 30 by the number of days in a month.\n\nThere are 30 days in a month, so the number of days between two full moons is 30 / 30 = 1 day.\n\nSince the last full moon occurred on a Friday, we need to find the number of days from the last full moon to the next full moon on a Friday.\n\nWe know that a full moon occurs every 29.5 days, so we can find the number of days from the last full moon to the next full moon by multiplying 29.5 by the number of days from the last full moon to the next full moon.\n\nSince the last full moon occurred on a Friday, the number of days from the last full moon to the next full moon is 7 days (Friday to Friday).\n\nTherefore, the number of days from the last full moon to the next full moon on a Friday is 29.5 \\* 7 = 206.5 days.\n\nThe answer is 206.5 days.", "answer": 210, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/808.png"}
