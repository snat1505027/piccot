{"question": "A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?", "qid": "840", "response": "The worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day.\n\nLet's start by finding the total distance the worm has to climb to reach the top of the hole. The worm has to climb up 26 inches - the depth of the hole - and then add the distance it climbs up each day, which is 8 inches. So, the total distance the worm has to climb is 26 + 8 = 34 inches.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days it will take the worm to reach the top. To do this, we need to divide the total distance the worm has to climb by the distance it climbs up and slides back each day, which is 3 inches.\n\n34 inches / 3 inches = 11.333...\n\nSince the worm cannot climb a fraction of an inch, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of days. Therefore, it will take the worm 12 days to reach the top of the hole.\n\nThe answer is 12 days.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/840.png"}
