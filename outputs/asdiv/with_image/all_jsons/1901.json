{"question": "Adam had 8 boxes of toys. Each box had 6 toys. Later Adam bought 5 more toys. How many toys did he have total?", "qid": "1901", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of toys in the 8 boxes. Each box contains 6 toys, so the total number of toys in the 8 boxes is 8 boxes x 6 toys per box = <<8*6=48>>48 toys.\n\nNext, we need to add the 5 toys Adam bought later to the total number of toys. The total number of toys after buying 5 more toys is 48 toys + 5 toys = <<48+5=53>>53 toys.\n\nThe answer is 53 toys.", "answer": 53, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1901.png"}
