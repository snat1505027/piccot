{"question": "At a restaurant the ratio of kids meals sold to adult meals sold was 2:1. If there were 8 kids meals sold, what is the combined amount of kids and adult meals sold?", "qid": "1512", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the combined amount of kids and adult meals sold. We know that the ratio of kids meals to adult meals is 2:1, which means that for every 2 kids meals, there is 1 adult meal.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of adult meals sold. We know that there were 8 kids meals sold, so we can use the ratio to find the number of adult meals:\n\n8 kids meals : 1 adult meal\n\nSo, there were 8/1 = <<8/1=8>>8 adult meals sold.\n\nNow, we have the combined amount of kids and adult meals sold:\n\n8 kids meals + 8 adult meals = <<8+8=16>>16 meals sold.\n\nThe answer is 16.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1512.png"}
