{"question": "It usually takes Stanley 10 hours to go around his two favorite places. If he took 10 times longer than the usual, how many hours did it take him to go around the places this time?", "qid": "399", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times longer it took Stanley to go around the places this time compared to the usual time.\n\nLet's start by looking at the image. The equation is:\n\nTime it usually takes = Number of times slower\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the number of times slower:\n\nNumber of times slower = Time it usually takes\n\nNow, we know that it took Stanley 10 times longer than usual to go around the places this time. So, we can substitute the value of 10 in the equation:\n\n10 = Number of times slower\n\nTo find the number of times slower, we can divide both sides by 10:\n\nNumber of times slower = 1\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of 1 in the original equation to find the time it took Stanley to go around the places this time:\n\nTime it usually takes = Number of times slower\n\nTime it took Stanley to go around the places this time = Time it usually takes / Number of times slower\n\nTime it took Stanley to go around the places this time = 10 / 1\n\nTime it took Stanley to go around the places this time = 10\n\nThe answer is 10.", "answer": 100, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/399.png"}
