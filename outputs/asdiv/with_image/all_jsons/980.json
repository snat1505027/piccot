We can see that the number of stickers increases by 8 on each page.\n\n1. 8 stickers on the first page\n2. 8 + 8 = 16 stickers on the second page\n3. 16 + 8 = 24 stickers on the third page\n4. 24 + 8 = 32 stickers on the fourth page\n\nTo find the number of stickers on the fifth page, we need to add 8 to 32:\n\n32 + 8 = 40 stickers on the fifth page.\n\nThe answer is 40.", "answer": 40, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/980.png"}
