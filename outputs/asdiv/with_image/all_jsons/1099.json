{"question": "Kristen notices an identical number of two types of insects in her neighborhood: butterflies and fireflies. She always seems to observe butterflies in groups of 44 and fireflies in groups of 17. What is the smallest number of butterflies that she could have seen?", "qid": "1099", "response": "To find the smallest number of butterflies, we need to find the smallest number that can be expressed as 44 x 17. We can start by dividing 44 by 17, which gives us 2.588235294117647. Since we are looking for the smallest number, we can round down to 2.\n\nThe smallest number of butterflies that Kristen could have seen is 2 x 17 = 34.\n\nThe answer is 34.", "answer": 748, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1099.png"}
