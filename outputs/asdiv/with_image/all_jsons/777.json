{"question": "A ballet class wants to divide its 90 members into some large groups at 7 members each and some small groups at 3 members each. In order to make the least number of groups, how many small groups should be made?", "qid": "777", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of members that can be divided into large and small groups.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of large groups that can be made with 7 members each. We can do this by dividing the total number of members by 7.\n\n90 members \u00f7 7 members/group = 12.857142857 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nSo, there are 12 large groups that can be made with 7 members each.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of small groups that can be made with 3 members each. We can do this by dividing the total number of members by 3.\n\n90 members \u00f7 3 members/group = 30\n\nSo, there are 30 small groups that can be made with 3 members each.\n\nThe answer is 12 large groups and 30 small groups.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/777.png"}
