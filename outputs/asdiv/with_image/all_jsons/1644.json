{"question": "Sarah could send ten text messages a day. If she sent eight, how many text messages does she have left she can send? ", "qid": "1644", "response": "First, we need to find out how many text messages Sarah can send if she sent eight. We can do this by subtracting the number of text messages she sent from the total number of text messages she can send.\n\nSarah can send ten text messages a day. If she sent eight, we need to subtract eight from ten.\n\n8 - 10 = -2\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of text messages, we need to add the number of text messages back to the total.\n\n-2 + 10 = 8\n\nSo, if Sarah sent eight text messages, she would have eight text messages left that she can send.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1644.png"}
