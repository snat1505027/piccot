{"question": "Ben draws a circle inside a square piece of paper whose area is 400 square inches. He makes sure than the circle touches each side of the square. What is the area of the circle?", "qid": "1356", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the circle. The circle is inside a square, and the square has an area of 400 square inches. We can use the fact that the circle touches each side of the square to find its radius.\n\nLet's start by drawing a square with an area of 400 square inches. We can then draw a circle inside the square, making sure it touches each side. Since the circle touches each side, its radius will be equal to the length of the side of the square.\n\nThe side of the square is 10 inches, so the radius of the circle is also 10 inches. Now, we can use the formula for the area of a circle to find the area of the circle:\n\nArea of the circle = \u03c0 \u00d7 radius\u00b2\n\n\u03c0 is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14.\n\nArea of the circle = \u03c0 \u00d7 10\u00b2\n\nArea of the circle = 3.14 \u00d7 100\n\nArea of the circle = 314 square inches\n\nThe answer is 314 square inches.", "answer": 314, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1356.png"}
