{"question": "A bus can transport 48 passengers. If a school of 1,230 students and teachers are going on a field trip, how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?", "qid": "733", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of passengers on the bus. We know that the bus can transport 48 passengers, and we are given the number of students and teachers in the school.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of passengers. We can do this by adding the number of students and teachers:\n1,230 students + teachers = Total number of passengers\n\nNext, we need to find the number of passengers on the bus. We can do this by dividing the total number of passengers by the number of passengers the bus can transport:\nTotal number of passengers \u00f7 Number of passengers the bus can transport = Number of passengers on the bus\n\nSo, the number of passengers on the bus is:\n1,230 students + teachers \u00f7 48 passengers = 25.83 passengers\n\nSince the bus is not fully occupied, we can round this number down to 25 passengers.\n\nThe answer is 25 passengers.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/733.png"}
