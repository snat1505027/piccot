{"question": "A sofa and a love seat together costs $444. The sofa costs double the love seat. How much do they each cost?", "qid": "1310", "response": "Let's start by finding the cost of the love seat. We know that the sofa costs double the love seat, so we can set up the equation:\n\nSofa cost = 2 x Love seat cost\n\nWe also know that the total cost of the sofa and love seat together is $444. We can set up another equation:\n\nSofa cost + Love seat cost = Total cost\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. Sofa cost = 2 x Love seat cost\n2. Sofa cost + Love seat cost = Total cost\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:\n\n2 x Love seat cost + Love seat cost = Total cost\n\n3 x Love seat cost = Total cost\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the cost of the love seat:\n\nLove seat cost = Total cost / 3\n\nLove seat cost = $444 / 3\n\nLove seat cost = $148.33\n\nNow that we have the cost of the love seat, we can find the cost of the sofa. We know that the sofa costs double the love seat, so we can multiply the cost of the love seat by 2:\n\nSofa cost = 2 x Love seat cost\n\nSofa cost = 2 x $148.33\n\nSofa cost = $296.66\n\nThe answer is $148.33 for the love seat and $296.66 for the sofa.", "answer": 148, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1310.png"}
