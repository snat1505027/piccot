If this pattern continues, how many note cards will the teacher give to the fifth student?", "qid": "1059", "response": "The teacher is handing out note cards to her students. She gave 3 note cards to the first student, 12 note cards to the second student, 48 note cards to the third student, and 192 note cards to the fourth student. If this pattern continues, how many note cards will the teacher give to the fifth student?\n\nStep 1: Identify the pattern in the number of note cards given to each student.\nThe pattern is that the number of note cards given to each subsequent student is the sum of the previous two students' note cards.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of note cards given to the fifth student.\nTo find the number of note cards given to the fifth student, we need to add the note cards given to the fourth and third students.\n48 + 192 = 240\n\nThe answer is 240.", "answer": 768, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1059.png"}
