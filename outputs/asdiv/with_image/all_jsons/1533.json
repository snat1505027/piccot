{"question": "Adam could fit nine action figures on each shelf in his room. His room has three shelves. How many action figures total could his shelves hold?", "qid": "1533", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of action figures that Adam's shelves can hold. We know that each shelf can hold nine action figures, and there are three shelves in total.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of action figures that one shelf can hold. We can do this by dividing the total number of action figures by the number of shelves:\n\n9 action figures per shelf \u00f7 3 shelves = 3 action figures per shelf\n\nNow, we know that each shelf can hold three action figures. To find the total number of action figures that all shelves can hold, we multiply the number of action figures per shelf by the number of shelves:\n\n3 action figures per shelf \u00d7 3 shelves = 9 action figures\n\nThe answer is 9 action figures.", "answer": 27, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1533.png"}
