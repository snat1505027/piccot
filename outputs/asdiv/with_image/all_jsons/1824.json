{"question": "Enzo and Beatriz are playing games at their local arcade. Incredibly, Enzo wins 5 tickets from every game, and Beatriz wins 11 tickets from every game. When they stopped playing games, Enzo and Beatriz had won the same number of total tickets. What is the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played?", "qid": "1824", "response": "To find the minimum number of games Enzo could have played, we need to find the total number of tickets Enzo and Beatriz have won and divide it by the number of tickets Enzo wins per game.\n\nLet's start by finding the total number of tickets Enzo and Beatriz have won. Enzo wins 5 tickets from every game, and Beatriz wins 11 tickets from every game. The total number of tickets they have won is:\n\n5 (Enzo's tickets) + 11 (Beatriz's tickets) = 16\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of games Enzo could have played to win 16 tickets. To do this, we divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets Enzo wins per game:\n\n16 (total tickets) \u00f7 5 (Enzo's tickets per game) = 3.2\n\nSince Enzo could not have played a fraction of a game, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of games. Therefore, the minimum number of games Enzo could have played is 4.\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 11, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1824.png"}
