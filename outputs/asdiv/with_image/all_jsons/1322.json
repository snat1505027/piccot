{"question": "The second angle of a triangle is five times as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?", "qid": "1322", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of the first angle. Let's start by using the information that the second angle is five times as large as the first angle. We can represent this as:\n\nSecond angle = 5 \\* First angle\n\nNext, we know that the third angle is 12 degrees greater than the first angle. We can represent this as:\n\nThird angle = First angle + 12\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the second angle into the expression for the third angle:\n\nThird angle = (5 \\* First angle) + 12\n\nTo solve for the first angle, we can simplify the expression:\n\nFirst angle = (Third angle - 12) / 5\n\nNow, we need to find the measure of the first angle. To do this, we can substitute the expression for the first angle into the expression for the third angle:\n\nThird angle = (First angle + 12) \\* 5\n\nWe can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides by 5:\n\nThird angle = 5 \\* (First angle + 12)\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for the first angle into this equation:\n\nThird angle = 5 \\* ((Third angle - 12) / 5)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nThird angle = 5 \\* Third angle - 60\n\nThird angle = 4 \\* Third angle - 60\n\nThird angle = 3 \\* Third angle - 240\n\nThird angle = 2 \\* Third angle - 720\n\nThird angle = Third angle - 1200\n\nThird angle = Third angle + 1200\n\nThird angle = 0 + Third angle\n\nThird angle = Third angle\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the third angle into the expression for the first angle:\n\nFirst angle = (Third angle - 12) / 5\n\nFirst angle = (0 - 12) / 5\n\nFirst angle = -6 / 5\n\nFirst angle = -3/5\n\nThe answer is 3/5.", "answer": 24, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1322.png"}
