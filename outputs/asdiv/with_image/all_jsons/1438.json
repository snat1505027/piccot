{"question": "There are 336 students in a school. If the school has 7 grades and each grade had the same number of students, how many students were in each grade?", "qid": "1438", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students per grade. We know that there are 336 students in total and 7 grades. Let's assume that the number of students in each grade is x.\n\nWe can set up the following equation:\n\nx \\* 7 = 336\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\nx = 336 / 7\n\nx = 48\n\nSo, there are 48 students in each grade.\n\nThe answer is 48.", "answer": 48, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1438.png"}
