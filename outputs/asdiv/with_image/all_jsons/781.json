{"question": "A farmer bought 164 rabbits. If the farmer wanted to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?", "qid": "781", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of rabbits that can be placed in each cage. Let's assume that the number of rabbits in each cage is x.\n\n1. We know that the farmer bought 164 rabbits.\n2. We also know that the farmer wants to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits.\n\nTo find the number of rabbits in each cage, we can use the following equation:\n\n164 rabbits / 17 cages = x rabbits per cage\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 164 rabbits / 17 cages\nx = 96 rabbits per cage\n\nSince the farmer already has 164 rabbits, the number of rabbits needed to fill the 17 cages is 96 rabbits per cage.\n\nTo find the total number of rabbits needed, we can multiply the number of rabbits per cage by the number of cages:\n\n96 rabbits/cage \\* 17 cages = 1624 rabbits\n\nThe farmer needs to buy 1624 rabbits to fill all 17 cages.\n\nThe answer is 1624 rabbits.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/781.png"}
