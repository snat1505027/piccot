{"question": "This afternoon, Alec noticed that the number of the page assigned for homework is divisible by both 4 and 13. What is the smallest possible page number that could have been assigned?", "qid": "1098", "response": "To find the smallest possible page number, we need to find the smallest number that is divisible by both 4 and 13. We can start by finding the smallest multiple of 4 and 13.\n\n13 x 4 = 52\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest number that is greater than 52 and divisible by both 4 and 13. We can do this by adding 1 to 52 and then dividing it by 4 and 13.\n\n53 \u00f7 4 = 13\n53 \u00f7 13 = 4\n\nSince 53 is not divisible by both 4 and 13, we need to add 1 to 53 and then divide it by 4 and 13.\n\n54 \u00f7 4 = 13\n54 \u00f7 13 = 4\n\nSince 54 is not divisible by both 4 and 13, we need to add 1 to 54 and then divide it by 4 and 13.\n\n55 \u00f7 4 = 13\n55 \u00f7 13 = 4\n\nSince 55 is not divisible by both 4 and 13, we need to add 1 to 55 and then divide it by 4 and 13.\n\n56 \u00f7 4 = 14\n56 \u00f7 13 = 4\n\nSince 56 is divisible by both 4 and 13, it is the smallest possible page number that could have been assigned.\n\nThe answer is 56.", "answer": 52, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1098.png"}
