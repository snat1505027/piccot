{"question": "Victor and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop for eight dollars each. How much did they spend if Victor bought six decks and his friend bought two decks?", "qid": "2002", "response": "The problem states that Victor bought six decks and his friend bought two decks. The cost of each deck is eight dollars. To find the total cost spent, we need to multiply the number of decks bought by each person by the cost of each deck.\n\n6 decks bought by Victor \\* $8 per deck = $<<6*8=48>>48\n2 decks bought by friend \\* $8 per deck = $<<2*8=16>>16\n\nThe total cost spent is the sum of the cost spent by Victor and his friend: $48 + $16 = $<<48+16=64>>64.\n\nThe answer is $64.", "answer": 64, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2002.png"}
