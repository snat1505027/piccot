{"question": "During a class election the ratio of students who voted for candidate A compared to candidate B was 2:1. If candidate A received 14 votes, what is the combined amount of votes candidate A and candidate B received?", "qid": "1491", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of votes candidate B received. We know that the ratio of votes for candidate A to candidate B is 2:1, and candidate A received 14 votes. Let's start by finding the number of votes candidate B received.\n\n14 (candidate A) / 2 (ratio) = x (candidate B)\n\nx = 14 / 2\nx = 7\n\nNow that we have the number of votes for candidate B, we can find the combined amount of votes for both candidates.\n\nCombined votes = candidate A votes + candidate B votes\nCombined votes = 14 + 7\nCombined votes = 21\n\nThe answer is 21.", "answer": 21, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1491.png"}
