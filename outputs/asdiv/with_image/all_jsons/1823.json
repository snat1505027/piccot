{"question": "Sherman goes golfing every 6th day and Brad goes golfing every 7th day. If Sherman and Brad both went golfing today, how many days until they will go golfing on the same day again?", "qid": "1823", "response": "To find the number of days until Sherman and Brad will go golfing on the same day again, we need to find the common multiple of 6 and 7.\n\nFirst, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 7, which is 42.\n\nNext, we can divide 42 by 6 and 7 to find the number of days until they will go golfing on the same day again:\n\n42 \u00f7 6 = 7\n42 \u00f7 7 = 6\n\nSo, it will be 7 days until Sherman and Brad will go golfing on the same day again.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 42, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1823.png"}
