{"question": "The sum total of the ages of father and the son is 55 years. If the father was to live till his son's age equals his present age. The total of their ages would be 93 years. Find their present ages.", "qid": "1278", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. The sum total of the ages of father and son is 55 years. We can represent this as:\n\nFather's age + Son's age = 55\n\nNext, we know that the father will live until his son's age equals his present age. We can represent this as:\n\nFather's age = Son's age - (Father's age - Son's age)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nFather's age = 2 \\* Son's age - 55\n\nNow, we can substitute the equation for Father's age into the first equation to get:\n\n2 \\* Son's age - 55 + Son's age = 55\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n3 \\* Son's age = 55 + 55\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n3 \\* Son's age = 110\n\nSon's age = 110 / 3\n\nSon's age = 36.67\n\nSince the son's age must be a whole number, we can round it down to 36 years.\n\nNow, we can find the father's age by substituting Son's age into the equation we derived earlier:\n\nFather's age = 2 \\* Son's age - 55\n\nFather's age = 2 \\* 36 - 55\n\nFather's age = 72 - 55\n\nFather's age = 17\n\nThe answer is: The father is 17 years old, and the son is 36 years old.", "answer": 37, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1278.png"}
