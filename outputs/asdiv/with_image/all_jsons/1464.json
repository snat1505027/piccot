{"question": "The woods behind Wendy's house were 8 miles wide and have an area of 24 square miles. What is the length of the woods?", "qid": "1464", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the woods. We know that the woods are 8 miles wide and have an area of 24 square miles. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the length of the woods.\n\nArea = length x width\n\nSince the woods have an area of 24 square miles, we can set up the equation:\n\n24 = length x 8\n\nNow, we need to solve for the length of the woods. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n\n3 = length\n\nSince the length of the woods is 3 miles, the answer is:\n\nThe length of the woods is 3 miles.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1464.png"}
