{"question": "A carpenter had a board that was 5.28 m long. She used her circular saw to cut 9 cm off the end of the board. How many centimeters long was the board after the carpenter cut it?", "qid": "1046", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the board after the carpenter cut it. We can use the information provided in the image to help us.\n\n1. The board was initially 5.28 meters long.\n2. The carpenter cut 9 cm off the end of the board.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the 9 cm to centimeters. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so we can divide 9 cm by 100 to get the number of centimeters:\n\n9 cm \u00f7 100 = 0.09 m\n\nNow, we can find the length of the board after the carpenter cut it by subtracting the length of the cut from the initial length:\n\n5.28 m - 0.09 m = 5.19 m\n\nTo convert the length from meters to centimeters, we multiply by 100:\n\n5.19 m \u00d7 100 cm/m = 519 cm\n\nThe answer is 519 centimeters.", "answer": 519, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1046.png"}
