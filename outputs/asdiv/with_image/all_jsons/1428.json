{"question": "Debby had 873 quarters. If it costs 3 quarters for each coke from a coke machine, how many could she buy?", "qid": "1428", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many coke machine purchases Debby can make with her 873 quarters.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the number of quarters into dollars. There are 25 cents in a quarter, so 873 quarters are equal to 873/25 = 35.292 dollars.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many coke machine purchases Debby can make with 35.292 dollars. If it costs 3 quarters for each coke, then it costs 35.292/25 = 1.4116 coke machine purchases.\n\nHowever, since Debby has 873 quarters, she can actually make 873/25 = 35.292 coke machine purchases.\n\nThe answer is 35.292.", "answer": 291, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1428.png"}
