{"question": "Carol had eighty-one pieces of paper in her folder. After a week she had thirty-eight left. How many pieces did she use in the week? ", "qid": "1735", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of paper Carol used in the week. We know that she had 81 pieces of paper in her folder and 38 pieces were left, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n81 pieces of paper - 38 pieces of paper = x pieces of paper used\n\nNow we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 38 to both sides of the equation:\n\n81 pieces of paper + 38 pieces of paper = 2x pieces of paper used\n\nNow we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n81/2 + 38/2 = x/2\n\nNow we can add the two numbers together and divide by 2 to find the answer:\n\n(81/2) + (38/2) = x/2\n\n(81 + 38) / 2 = x\n\n120 / 2 = x\n\nx = 60\n\nThe answer is 60.", "answer": 43, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1735.png"}
