{"question": "Peter has 18 oranges, 27 pears and 12 bananas. He wants to make fruit baskets with the same number of each fruit in each basket. What is the greatest number of fruit baskets he can make?", "qid": "1085", "response": "To find the greatest number of fruit baskets, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of each fruit.\n\n18 oranges \u00f7 GCD = 3\n27 pears \u00f7 GCD = 3\n12 bananas \u00f7 GCD = 3\n\nThe GCD of 18, 27, and 12 is 3.\n\nSo, Peter can make the greatest number of fruit baskets by dividing the total number of each fruit by the GCD:\n\n18 oranges \u00f7 3 = 6 baskets\n27 pears \u00f7 3 = 9 baskets\n12 bananas \u00f7 3 = 4 baskets\n\nThe total number of baskets is 6 + 9 + 4 = 19 baskets.\n\nThe answer is 19.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1085.png"}
