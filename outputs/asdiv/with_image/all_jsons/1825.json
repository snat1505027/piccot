What is the greatest number of packages Tim can make?", "qid": "1825", "response": "To find the greatest number of packages Tim can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 39 and 13. The GCD of 39 and 13 is 1.\n\nSince the GCD is 1, Tim can make 1 package for each pair of headphones and music player. Therefore, the greatest number of packages Tim can make is 39.\n\nThe answer is 39.", "answer": 13, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1825.png"}
