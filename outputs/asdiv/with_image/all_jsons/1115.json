{"question": "A pizza store had 11 pieces of pepperoni to put on their pizzas. If each pizza got 2 pieces, how many extra pieces of pepperoni would they have?", "qid": "1115", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pizzas can be made with the given number of pepperoni pieces.\n\n11 pieces of pepperoni can be divided by 2 to find the number of pizzas that can be made:\n11 \u00f7 2 = 5.5\n\nSince we can't make a half pizza, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of pizzas.\n\n5.5 \u2248 6\n\nNow, we know that each pizza gets 2 pieces of pepperoni. So, we can find out how many extra pieces of pepperoni there are by subtracting the total number of pieces of pepperoni used from the total number of pieces of pepperoni available:\n\n6 pizzas \u00d7 2 pieces of pepperoni per pizza = 12 pieces of pepperoni used\n11 pieces of pepperoni - 12 pieces of pepperoni used = 11 - 12 = -1\n\nSince we can't have a negative number of extra pieces of pepperoni, we need to adjust our answer. We can either add 1 piece of pepperoni to the total used or subtract 1 piece of pepperoni from the total available. Since we are trying to find the extra pieces of pepperoni, we should subtract 1 piece of pepperoni from the total available:\n\n11 pieces of pepperoni - 1 piece of pepperoni = 10 pieces of pepperoni\n\nThe answer is 10 pieces of pepperoni.", "answer": 1, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1115.png"}
