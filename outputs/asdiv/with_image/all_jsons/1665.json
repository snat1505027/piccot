{"question": "A chef used fifteen apples to make a pie. Now he has four apples left. How many apples did he have before he made the pie? ", "qid": "1665", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of apples the chef had before he made the pie. We know that he used fifteen apples to make the pie and now he has four apples left. We can set up the following equation:\n\nApples before pie - Apples used to make pie = Apples left\n\nWe can substitute the given values into the equation:\n\nApples before pie - 15 = 4\n\nNow, we need to solve for the number of apples before the pie. To do this, we can add 15 to both sides of the equation:\n\nApples before pie = 15 + 4\n\nApples before pie = 19\n\nThe answer is 19.", "answer": 19, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1665.png"}
