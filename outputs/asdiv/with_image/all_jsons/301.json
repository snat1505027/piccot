{"question": "The path opened to a beautiful garden enclosed by a wall. The exit door will open when the number of white flowers is the same as the number of red flowers. If there are 555 white flowers and 347 red flowers, how many more red flowers are needed?", "qid": "301", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of white flowers and red flowers.\n\n555 white flowers - 347 red flowers = 208 more white flowers than red flowers.\n\nSince the exit door will open when the number of white flowers is the same as the number of red flowers, we need to add 208 red flowers to the current number of red flowers.\n\n347 red flowers + 208 red flowers = 555 red flowers.\n\nThe answer is 208 red flowers.", "answer": 208, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/301.png"}
