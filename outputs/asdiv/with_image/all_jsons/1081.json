{"question": "Allie has 5 math books and 10 science books. If she wants to distribute them evenly among some bookshelves so that each bookshelf has the same combination of math and science books, with no books left over, what is the greatest number of bookshelves Allie can use?", "qid": "1081", "response": "To find the greatest number of bookshelves Allie can use, we need to distribute the total number of books (5 + 10 = 15) evenly among the bookshelves. We can do this by dividing the total number of books by the number of books per bookshelf.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of books per bookshelf. Since there are 15 books in total and we want to distribute them evenly, we can divide the total number of books by the number of bookshelves.\n\n15 books \u00f7 x bookshelves = 15/x\n\nTo find the greatest number of bookshelves, we need to maximize the value of x. We can do this by solving the equation for x:\n\n15/x = x\n\nx = 15\n\nThe greatest number of bookshelves Allie can use is 15.\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1081.png"}
