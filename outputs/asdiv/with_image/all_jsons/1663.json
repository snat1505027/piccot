{"question": "Cody had a bag of marbles. Later he gave five to his brother. Now Cody has seven marbles. How many marbles did Cody have to start with? ", "qid": "1663", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. Cody had a bag of marbles, and later he gave five to his brother. Now Cody has seven marbles.\n\nLet's start by representing the initial number of marbles Cody had with the variable 'x'. We can then represent the number of marbles Cody gave to his brother with the variable 'y'.\n\nFrom the image, we know that:\nx - y = 7 (Cody has 7 marbles now)\nx + y = 5 (Cody gave 5 marbles to his brother)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by using the first equation to eliminate 'x' and then substituting the result into the second equation.\n\nFirst, we can solve the first equation for 'x':\nx = y + 7\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for 'x' into the second equation:\n(y + 7) + y = 5\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n2y + 7 = 5\n\nSubtracting 7 from both sides, we get:\n2y = 5 - 7\n2y = -2\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\ny = -1\n\nNow we can substitute the value of 'y' back into the first equation to find the value of 'x':\nx = y + 7\nx = -1 + 7\nx = 6\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1663.png"}
