{"question": "Andrew found some empty bins to put cans into for recycling. He put 2 empty cans in the first bin, 4 empty cans in the second bin, 7 empty cans in the third bin, 11 empty cans in the fourth bin, and 16 empty cans in the fifth bin. If this pattern continues, how many empty cans will Andrew put in the sixth bin?", "qid": "1054", "response": "To find the number of empty cans in the sixth bin, we need to follow the pattern. The pattern is that the number of empty cans in each bin increases by 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. So, the number of empty cans in the sixth bin will be 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThe answer is 18.", "answer": 22, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1054.png"}
