{"question": "Matt and his friends were thinking of making Christmas decors for the clubhouse in their neighborhood. They are to repaint 350 balls in ten different colors. If they painted an equal number of balls for every color, how many balls are there for each color?", "qid": "481", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of balls for each color. We know that there are 350 balls in total, and they are to be painted in ten different colors. Let's assume that the number of balls for each color is x.\n\nThe total number of balls is 350, and the number of colors is 10. We can write the equation:\n\nx + x + x + ... + x = 350\n\nSince there are 10 colors, we can write the equation as:\n\n10x = 350\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:\n\nx = 35\n\nSo, the number of balls for each color is 35.\n\nThe answer is 35.", "answer": 35, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/481.png"}
