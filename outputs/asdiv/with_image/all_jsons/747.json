{"question": "The teacher gave 42 pencils to 12 students equally. How many pencils are left?", "qid": "747", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pencils each student received and then find out how many pencils are left.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many pencils each student received. To do this, we can divide the total number of pencils (42) by the number of students (12).\n\n42 pencils \u00f7 12 students = 3.5 pencils per student\n\nSince we cannot give a fraction of a pencil, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n3.5 pencils per student \u2248 4 pencils per student\n\nNow, we know that each student received 4 pencils. To find out how many pencils are left, we can subtract the total number of pencils received by all students from the total number of pencils given by the teacher.\n\n42 pencils - (12 students x 4 pencils per student) = 42 pencils - 48 pencils = -6 pencils\n\nSince there are negative pencils left, it means that there are no pencils left.\n\nThe answer is 0 pencils left.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/747.png"}
