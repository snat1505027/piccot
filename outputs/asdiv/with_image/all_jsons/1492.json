{"question": "While completing a race, Ned spent 63 minutes walking. If his ratio of time walking to jogging was 9:1, how many minutes did he spend completing the race?", "qid": "1492", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the time Ned spent jogging. We know that his ratio of time walking to jogging was 9:1, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nTime spent walking (63 minutes) / Time spent jogging = 9:1\n\nNow, we need to find the time spent jogging. To do this, we can multiply the time spent walking by the ratio (9:1):\n\n63 minutes / 9 = 7 minutes\n\nSo, Ned spent 7 minutes jogging.\n\nNext, we need to find the total time he spent completing the race. We know that the time spent walking was 63 minutes, and the time spent jogging was 7 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent was:\n\n63 minutes + 7 minutes = 70 minutes\n\nThe answer is 70 minutes.", "answer": 70, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1492.png"}
