{"question": "A florist needed to use 2 pounds of fertilizer for 9 days and then on the final day use the normal amount plus another 4 pounds. How many pounds of fertilizer will she use all together?", "qid": "1896", "response": "The florist needed to use 2 pounds of fertilizer for 9 days, which means she will use 2 pounds of fertilizer for each of the 9 days. So, the total amount of fertilizer she will use for the 9 days is 2 pounds x 9 days = <<2*9=18>>18 pounds.\n\nOn the final day, she will use the normal amount of fertilizer plus an additional 4 pounds, which means she will use 18 pounds + 4 pounds = <<18+4=22>>22 pounds of fertilizer on the final day.\n\nSo, the total amount of fertilizer she will use all together is 18 pounds + 22 pounds = <<18+22=40>>40 pounds.\n\nThe answer is 40 pounds.", "answer": 22, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1896.png"}
