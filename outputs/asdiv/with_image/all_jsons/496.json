{"question": "Instead of buying from the store, Melody made Christmas cards for the elderly in a nursing home. She had 99 blue sequins which she plans to use as snowflakes for the cards. If she distributes the sequins equally to 12 cards, how many sequins will Melody have left?", "qid": "496", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sequins Melody will have left after distributing them equally to 12 cards.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of sequins per card. To do this, we can divide the total number of sequins (99) by the number of cards (12).\n\n99 sequins \u00f7 12 cards = 8.25 sequins per card\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a sequin, we need to round the number of sequins per card to the nearest whole number.\n\n8.25 sequins per card \u2248 8 sequins per card\n\nNow that we know the number of sequins per card, we can find the total number of sequins Melody will have left after distributing them equally to 12 cards.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the number of sequins per card (8) by the number of cards (12).\n\n8 sequins per card \u00d7 12 cards = 96 sequins\n\nThe answer is 96 sequins.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/496.png"}
