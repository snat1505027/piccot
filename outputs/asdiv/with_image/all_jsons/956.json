{"question": "Angela won a contest. She gets $90 to spend at Puzzle Palace. She bought many wonderful puzzles. She had $12 left. How much did she spend?", "qid": "956", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the amount Angela spent at Puzzle Palace. We know that she had $90 to spend and $12 left, so we can set up an equation to represent this information.\n\nLet's call the amount Angela spent \"x\". We can write the equation as:\n\nx - $12 = $90\n\nNow, we need to solve for \"x\". To do this, we can add $12 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx = $90 + $12\n\nx = $102\n\nThe answer is $102.", "answer": 78, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/956.png"}
