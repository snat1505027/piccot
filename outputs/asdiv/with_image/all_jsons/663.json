{"question": "There are some passengers on a bus. At a bus stop, 7 more passengers got on the bus and 9 passengers got off. If there are 26 passengers in the bus in the end, how many passengers were there at first?", "qid": "663", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of passengers at the first stop. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\nAt the first stop, there were 26 passengers on the bus.\n\nAt the second stop, 7 passengers got on the bus, so the total number of passengers at the second stop is 26 + 7 = 33.\n\nAt the second stop, 9 passengers got off the bus, so the total number of passengers at the second stop is 33 - 9 = 24.\n\nSince the number of passengers at the second stop is 24, we can conclude that there were 24 passengers at the first stop.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 28, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/663.png"}
