{"question": "Alyssa has 30 books in her library. She bought several books at a yard sale over the weekend. She now has 88 books in her library. How many books did she buy at the yard sale ?", "qid": "1230", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of books Alyssa bought at the yard sale. We can do this by subtracting the number of books she had before the yard sale (30) from the number of books she has now (88).\n\n30 - 88 = -58\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of books, we need to add 58 to both sides of the equation to make it a positive number.\n\n30 + 58 = 88\n\nNow we can solve for the number of books Alyssa bought at the yard sale:\n\n88 - 30 = 58\n\nThe answer is 58.", "answer": 58, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1230.png"}
