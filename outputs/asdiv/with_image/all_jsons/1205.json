{"question": "The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 54 cm. Find the length of each side of triangle.", "qid": "1205", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length of a side and W is the width of the triangle. Since the perimeter is given as 54 cm, we can start by finding the length of one side of the triangle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the base of the triangle. The base is the side that is parallel to the floor. Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal. Let's call the length of the base L.\n\nNext, we can find the length of the other side of the triangle, which is the height. The height is the side that goes from the base to the opposite vertex. Let's call the length of the height H.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the perimeter: P = 2L + 2H. We know that P = 54 cm, so we can substitute that value into the formula:\n\n54 = 2L + 2H\n\nTo solve for L, we can subtract 2H from both sides:\n\n54 - 2H = 2L\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 2 to find L:\n\n(54 - 2H) / 2 = L\n\nL = (54 - 2H) / 2\n\nSince we don't know the value of H, we cannot find the exact length of L. However, we can find the length of each side of the triangle by using the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's call the length of the hypotenuse X. Then, we can write:\n\nX^2 = L^2 + H^2\n\nSince we know the length of the base (L) and the height (H), we can substitute those values into the equation:\n\nX^2 = L^2 + H^2\n\nX^2 = (L/2)^2 + H^2\n\nNow, we can solve for X:\n\nX = \u221a[(L/2", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1205.png"}
