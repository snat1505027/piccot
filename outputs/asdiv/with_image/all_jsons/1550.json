We know that he read three chapters, and each chapter was eight pages. We can use the information from the image to help us find the answer.\n\nIn the image, there is a box with the number 8 inside it. This number represents the number of pages in each chapter. We can use this information to find the total number of pages Tom read.\n\nTo find the total number of pages, we need to multiply the number of chapters by the number of pages in each chapter. We can do this by using the equation:\n\ntotal pages = chapters x pages per chapter\n\nIn this case, the total pages would be:\n\ntotal pages = 3 x 8\n\nThe answer is 24 pages.", "answer": 24, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1550.png"}
