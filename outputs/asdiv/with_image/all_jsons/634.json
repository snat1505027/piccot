{"question": "A group of 4 children and 3 adults are going to the zoo. Child tickets cost $3, and adult tickets cost $6. How much will the zoo tickets cost in all?", "qid": "634", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of zoo tickets for the group of 4 children and 3 adults.\n\n1. First, we need to find the cost of child tickets for the group. Since there are 4 children, we multiply the cost of a child ticket by 4: $3 x 4 = $12.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the cost of adult tickets for the group. Since there are 3 adults, we multiply the cost of an adult ticket by 3: $6 x 3 = $18.\n\n3. Now, we add the cost of child tickets and adult tickets to find the total cost of zoo tickets for the group: $12 + $18 = $30.\n\nThe answer is $30.", "answer": 30, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/634.png"}
