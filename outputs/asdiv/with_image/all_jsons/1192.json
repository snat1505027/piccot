{"question": "If a number is subtracted from 32, the digits of 32 are interchanged. Find the number.", "qid": "1192", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number that, when subtracted from 32, results in the digits of 32 being interchanged.\n\nFirst, we can start by looking at the digits of 32: 3 and 2.\n\nNext, we can try subtracting the number 2 from 32. When we do this, the digits of 32 are interchanged, so we get 32 - 2 = 30.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer, as the problem states that the digits of 32 are interchanged, not just the order of the digits.\n\nLet's try subtracting the number 3 from 32 instead. When we do this, the digits of 32 are interchanged, so we get 32 - 3 = 29.\n\nTherefore, the number that, when subtracted from 32, results in the digits of 32 being interchanged is 3.\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 55, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1192.png"}
