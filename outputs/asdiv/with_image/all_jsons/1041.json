{"question": "Cory made 4500 g of candy. He saved 1 kg to eat later. He divided the rest of the candy over 7 bowls to serve at his party. How many grams of candy did Cory serve in each bowl?", "qid": "1041", "response": "First, we need to find the total amount of candy Cory saved to eat later. We know that he saved 1 kg of candy, so we can convert that to grams by multiplying by 1000.\n\n1 kg = 1000 grams\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount of candy Cory divided over 7 bowls. We know that he divided the rest of the candy over 7 bowls, so we can find the total amount of candy by dividing the initial amount by 7.\n\n4500 g \u00f7 7 = 642.857 g\n\nFinally, we can find the number of grams of candy served in each bowl by dividing the total amount of candy divided by the number of bowls.\n\n642.857 g \u00f7 7 = 91.839 g\n\nThe answer is 91.839 g.", "answer": 500, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1041.png"}
