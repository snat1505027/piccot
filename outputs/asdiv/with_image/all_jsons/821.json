We know that Greg ate 4 halves, and his brother, Brad, ate 6 halves. We also know that there were 18 halves left.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of whole cookies that Greg's mom made. We can do this by adding the number of halves Greg ate and the number of halves Brad ate.\n\n4 + 6 = 10\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of cookies that Greg's mom made by multiplying the number of whole cookies by the number of halves left.\n\n10 \u00d7 18 = 180\n\nThe answer is 180.", "answer": 14, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/821.png"}
