{"question": "Each day you put a bag of garbage that weighs 55 pounds in the dumpster. How many pounds of garbage will you put in the dumpster in 4 weeks?", "qid": "517", "response": "To find the total weight of garbage in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the weight of garbage per day by the number of days in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, and 4 weeks have 28 days. So, the number of days in 4 weeks is 7 days/week \\* 4 weeks = 28 days.\n\nNext, we need to multiply the weight of garbage per day by the number of days in 4 weeks: 55 pounds/day \\* 28 days = 1630 pounds.\n\nThe answer is 1630 pounds.", "answer": 1540, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/517.png"}
