{"question": "A video game map had a total area of 10 square meters. If the map was 5 meters long, how wide is it?", "qid": "1475", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the map. We know that the total area of the map is 10 square meters and the length of the map is 5 meters. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n\nSince we know the length is 5 meters, we can use that value to find the width. First, we need to convert the length from meters to square meters:\n\n5 meters x 100000 square meters/meter = 500000 square meters\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\nWidth = Total Area / Length\n\nWidth = 10 square meters / 500000 square meters/meter = 0.0002 meters\n\nTo convert the width from square meters to meters, we can multiply by 100000:\n\nWidth = 0.0002 meters x 100000 meters/square meter = 2 meters\n\nThe answer is 2 meters.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1475.png"}
