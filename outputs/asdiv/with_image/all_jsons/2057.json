{"question": "Sean had 45 Starbursts. If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?", "qid": "2057", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of Starbursts Sean had initially and then find the number of Starbursts he gave to his friends. We can then find the number of Starbursts left and divide it by the number of friends to find the number of Starbursts each person ate.\n\n1. Sean had 45 Starbursts initially.\n2. Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends.\n3. Sean had 45 - 18 = <<45-18=27>>27 Starbursts left.\n4. To find the number of Starbursts each person ate, we need to divide the number of Starbursts left by the number of friends.\n5. 27 / 18 = <<27/18=1.5>>1.5.\n6. Since we cannot eat a fraction of a Starburst, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n7. The answer is 1.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2057.png"}
