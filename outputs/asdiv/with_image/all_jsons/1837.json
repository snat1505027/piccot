{"question": "There are 72 boys and 90 girls on the math team. For the next math competition, Mr. Johnson would like to arrange all of the students in equal rows with only girls or only boys in each row. What is the greatest number of students that can be in each row?", "qid": "1837", "response": "To find the greatest number of students that can be in each row, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of boys and girls.\n\n72 (boys) \u00f7 2 = 36\n90 (girls) \u00f7 2 = 45\n\nThe GCD of 36 and 45 is 1.\n\nSo, the greatest number of students that can be in each row is 1.\n\nThe answer is 1.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1837.png"}
