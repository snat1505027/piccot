{"question": "A square has a perimeter of 24 inches. What is the area of the square?", "qid": "1338", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each side of the square. We know that the perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 24 inches.\n\nLet's start by dividing 24 by 4, which is the number of sides in a square. 24 \u00f7 4 = 6. This means that each side of the square is 6 inches long.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the square. The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of each side by itself and then adding the results. In this case, the area of the square is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36 square inches.\n\nThe answer is 36 square inches.", "answer": 36, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1338.png"}
