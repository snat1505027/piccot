{"question": "5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son. Find the present ages.", "qid": "1273", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the image. The image shows a chart with the ages of a father and son at different points in time. We can use this chart to determine the present ages of the father and son.\n\nFirst, we need to find the age of the son at the present time. From the chart, we can see that the son's age is 5 years earlier than the father's age. Therefore, the son's age is 5 - 5 = 0 years.\n\nNext, we need to find the father's age at the present time. From the chart, we can see that the father's age is three times the son's age. Therefore, the father's age is 3 x 0 = 0 years.\n\nHowever, this answer does not make sense since the father cannot be younger than his son. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach.\n\nLooking at the chart, we can see that the father's age is 7 times the son's age 5 years earlier. This means that the father's age is 7 x (5 - 5) = 7 x 0 = 0 years.\n\nAgain, this answer does not make sense since the father cannot be younger than his son. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach.\n\nLooking at the chart, we can see that the father's age is 3 times the son's age 5 years hence. This means that the father's age is 3 x (son's age + 5) = 3 x (0 + 5) = 15 years.\n\nSimilarly, the son's age 5 years hence is 5 years older than his age now, which is 0 years. Therefore, the son's age 5 years hence is 5 years.\n\nThe answer is: The father is 15 years old, and the son is 5 years old.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1273.png"}
