{"question": "Mrs.Martin is 27 years older than her daughter Neil. After 8 years she will be twice as old as Neil. Find their present ages.", "qid": "1263", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the present ages of Mrs. Martin and Neil. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\n1. Mrs. Martin is 27 years older than her daughter Neil.\n2. After 8 years, Mrs. Martin will be twice as old as Neil.\n\nWe can use the information from the image to create a system of equations. Let's call the present age of Mrs. Martin \"M\" and the present age of Neil \"N\".\n\n1. M = N + 27\n2. M = 2N + 8\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system of equations using the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the substitution method.\n\nFirst, we can solve equation 1 for N:\n\nN = M - 27\n\nNext, we can substitute the expression for N into equation 2:\n\nM = 2(M - 27) + 8\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nM = 2M - 54 + 8\n\nM = 2M - 46\n\nWe can solve for M by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n\nM = (2M - 46) + 46\n\nM = 2M - 46 + 46\n\nM = 2M\n\nNow, we can solve for M by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n\nM = 2M\n\nM = 2M - 46\n\nM = 2M - 46 + 46\n\nM = 2M\n\nThis equation is true by definition, so we can conclude that:\n\nM = 2N + 8\n\nN = M - 8\n\nNow we can find the present ages of Mrs. Martin and Neil. We know that Mrs. Martin is 27 years older than Neil, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nM = N + 27\n\nN = M - 27\n\nN = M - 27\n\nM = N + 27\n\nN = M - 27\n\nN = M - 27\n\nThis equation is true by definition, so we", "answer": 46, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1263.png"}
