{"question": "Math Magazine charges $8 per square inch for advertising. Jason decides to order a half page ad. Each page of the magazine measures 9 inches by 12 inches. How much will Jason have to pay?", "qid": "1345", "response": "To find the cost of the half page ad, we need to calculate the area of the half page and multiply it by the advertising cost per square inch.\n\nFirst, we need to find the width and height of the half page. Since the page measures 9 inches by 12 inches, the width of the half page is 9/2 = 4.5 inches, and the height of the half page is 12/2 = 6 inches.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the area of the half page. The area of a rectangle is the product of its width and height. In this case, the area of the half page is 4.5 inches x 6 inches = 27 square inches.\n\nFinally, we multiply the area of the half page by the advertising cost per square inch to find the total cost for Jason. The total cost is 27 square inches x $8 per square inch = $216.\n\nThe answer is $216.", "answer": 432, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1345.png"}
