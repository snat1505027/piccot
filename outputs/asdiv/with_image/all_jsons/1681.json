{"question": "Sally memorized eight poems. After some time she could only recite three of them. How many poems did she forget? ", "qid": "1681", "response": "The image shows a table with the number of poems Sally memorized and the number of poems she could recite. The table has three rows, and the number of poems she could recite is three in each row.\n\nTo find the number of poems Sally forgot, we need to subtract the number of poems she could recite from the total number of poems she memorized. Since she could recite three poems in each row, we can find the total number of poems she could recite by multiplying the number of rows by the number of poems she could recite in each row.\n\nThe total number of poems she could recite is 3 x 3 = 9.\n\nTo find the number of poems she forgot, we need to subtract the total number of poems she could recite from the total number of poems she memorized. The number of poems she memorized is 8.\n\nThe number of poems Sally forgot is 8 - 9 = -1.\n\nThe answer is -1.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1681.png"}
