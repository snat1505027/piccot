{"question": "Abigail's mom said she will be home from work in 65 minutes. It is 4:27 p.m., and Abigail has dance practice at 6:00 p.m. How much time will Abigail have between the time that her mom gets home from work and the beginning of dance practice?", "qid": "1047", "response": "First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 65 minutes is equal to 1.08 hours.\n\nNext, we need to find the time difference between the time her mom gets home and the start of dance practice. 6:00 p.m. - 4:27 p.m. = 1.73 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find the time Abigail will have between her mom getting home and the start of dance practice. 1.08 hours - 1.73 hours = -0.65 hours.\n\nSince the answer is negative, it means Abigail will have less time between her mom getting home and the start of dance practice.\n\nThe answer is -0.65 hours.", "answer": 28, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1047.png"}
