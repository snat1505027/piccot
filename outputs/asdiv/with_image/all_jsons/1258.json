{"question": "Vidya's mother's age is 5 years more than the three times of Vidya's present age. Find Vidya's present age, if her mother is 44 years old.", "qid": "1258", "response": "First, we need to find the relationship between Vidya's present age and her mother's age. The problem states that Vidya's mother's age is 5 years more than three times Vidya's present age. Let's represent this relationship with a mathematical equation:\n\nVidya's mother's age = 3 x Vidya's present age + 5\n\nWe know that Vidya's mother is 44 years old, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n44 = 3x + 5\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n44 - 5 = 3x\n39 = 3x\nx = 13\n\nNow that we have found the value of x, we can find Vidya's present age by substituting it back into the original equation:\n\nVidya's present age = 3x + 5\nVidya's present age = 13 + 5\nVidya's present age = 18\n\nThe answer is 18.", "answer": 13, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1258.png"}
