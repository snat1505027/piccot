The image shows a table with the ages of two friends, Anna and Ben, and their relatives.\n\n1. Anna's father Denver is twice as old as Anna and Ben.\n2. Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy.\n3. The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years.\n\nLet's start by finding the age of Anna. Since Denver is twice as old as Anna and Ben, we can find Anna's age by dividing Denver's age by 2.\n\nDenver's age = 2 \\* Anna's age + 30\n\nSince the ages of Anna and Ben differ by 3 years, we can find Ben's age by adding 3 years to Anna's age.\n\nBen's age = Anna's age + 3\n\nNow we have the ages of Anna and Ben:\n\nAnna's age = Denver's age / 2 - 30\nBen's age = Anna's age + 3\n\nThe answer is 73 and 76.", "answer": 19, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1279.png"}
