{"question": "Hugo had seventy-nine stickers in his sticker book. He got some more to add to his book and now he has one hundred-twenty stickers. How many did he add to his book?", "qid": "137", "response": "First, we need to find the difference between the number of stickers Hugo had before and after he got more.\n\n79 (stickers in the book) - 122 (stickers in the book now) = -43\n\nSince the number of stickers decreased, we need to find the negative of the difference.\n\n-43 (stickers) = 43 (stickers)\n\nNow, we can find the number of stickers Hugo added to his book by multiplying the number of stickers by 2.\n\n43 (stickers) x 2 = 86\n\nThe answer is 86.", "answer": 41, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/137.png"}
