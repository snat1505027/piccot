The number 15 represents the number of children, and the number 17 represents the number of adults.\n\nSince the number of adults is equal to the number of children, we can say that the number of adults is 15.\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 255, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1095.png"}
