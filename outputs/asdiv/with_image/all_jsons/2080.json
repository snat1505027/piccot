First, we need to find the total number of bananas in the collection. The image shows that there are 407 bananas in the collection.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups. In this case, there are 11 groups. So, we can calculate the size of each group by dividing the total number of bananas by the number of groups:\n\n407 bananas \u00f7 11 groups = 37 (approximately)\n\nSo, each group contains approximately 37 bananas.\n\nThe answer is 37 bananas.", "answer": 37, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2080.png"}
