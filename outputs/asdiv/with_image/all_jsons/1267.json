{"question": "Length of a rectangle is 8 m less than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, find its length and width.", "qid": "1267", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the image. The perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, and the length is 8 m less than twice the width. Let's start by finding the width first.\n\nPerimeter of a rectangle = 2(length + width)\n56 = 2(length + width)\n\nNow, we can solve for the width:\n\n2(length + width) = 56\nlength + width = 28\n\nSince the length is 8 m less than twice the width, we can find the length by subtracting 8 from 28:\n\nlength = 28 - 8 = 20\n\nNow that we have the length, we can find the width:\n\nwidth = 28 - length\nwidth = 28 - 20 = 8\n\nThe answer is:\nThe length of the rectangle is 20 m, and the width is 8 m.", "answer": 16, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1267.png"}
