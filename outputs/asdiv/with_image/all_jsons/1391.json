{"question": "A truck can hold four boxes. If you needed to move eight hundred seventy-one boxes across town, how many trips would you need to make?", "qid": "1391", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of trips needed to move the boxes. We know that a truck can hold four boxes, and we need to move 871 boxes.\n\nFirst, we can divide the number of boxes by the number of boxes a truck can hold:\n871 boxes \u00f7 4 boxes per truck = 217.75 trips\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of trips.\n\n217.75 trips \u2248 218 trips\n\nThe answer is 218 trips.", "answer": 218, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1391.png"}
