We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\nFirst, we know that the total number of apples in the three bags is 24. We can also see that the first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples, and the second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples.\n\nTo find the number of apples in the first and third bags together, we need to subtract the number of apples in the second and third bags from the total number of apples.\n\n24 (total) - 18 (second and third bags) = 6\n\nTherefore, the first and third bags contain a total of 6 apples.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 19, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/839.png"}
