{"question": "Jane can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day. If there are 248 vases of flowers to be arranged, how many days are needed for her to finish all the flower arrangements?", "qid": "726", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it would take for Jane to arrange all the vases of flowers. We can do this by dividing the total number of vases by the number of vases she can arrange in a day.\n\n248 vases \u00f7 16 vases per day = 15.5 vases per day\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a day, we need to round up the number of vases per day to the nearest whole number.\n\n15.5 vases per day \u2248 16 vases per day\n\nNow, we can find the number of days needed by dividing the total number of vases by the number of vases per day.\n\n248 vases \u00f7 16 vases per day = 15.5 days\n\nSince we rounded up the number of vases per day, we need to round up the number of days to the nearest whole number.\n\n15.5 days \u2248 16 days\n\nThe answer is 16 days.", "answer": 16, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/726.png"}
