{"question": "A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many washing machines are needed?", "qid": "720", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many washing machines are needed to wash 200 pounds of clothes per day.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many pounds of clothes can be washed by one washing machine per day. We know that one washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of pounds of clothes to be washed (200) by the number of pounds of clothes washed by one washing machine per day (28).\n\n200 pounds of clothes to be washed \u00f7 28 pounds of clothes washed by one washing machine per day = 7.14 washing machines needed.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a washing machine, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of washing machines needed.\n\nTherefore, we need 8 washing machines to wash 200 pounds of clothes per day.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/720.png"}
