We know that he reads 6 books each week.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many books are left to read in the series. We know that there are 30 books in total.\n\nNow, we can find out how many weeks it would take Roger to finish the series. We can do this by dividing the number of books left to read by the number of books he reads in a week.\n\nThe answer is 30 books / 6 books per week = <<30/6=5>>5 weeks.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1618.png"}
