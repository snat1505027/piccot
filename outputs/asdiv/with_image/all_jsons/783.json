{"question": "Mrs. Dalloway made 85 tarts. If she wants to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts, how many more tarts should she make?", "qid": "783", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many tarts Mrs. Dalloway needs to make to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of tarts per box. To do this, we can divide the total number of tarts by the number of boxes:\n\n85 tarts \u00f7 10 boxes = 8.5 tarts per box\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a tart, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of tarts per box. In this case, we can round up to 9 tarts per box.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more tarts Mrs. Dalloway needs to make to fill the 10 boxes with 9 tarts each. To do this, we can multiply the number of tarts per box by the number of boxes:\n\n9 tarts per box \u00d7 10 boxes = 90 tarts\n\nSince Mrs. Dalloway already made 85 tarts, she needs to make 90 tarts - 85 tarts = 5 tarts more.\n\nThe answer is 5 tarts.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/783.png"}
