{"question": "Lavender is making punch for the school dance. She mixes 3 parts lemonade with 5 parts cranberry juice. She wants to fill a 72 cup bowl. How many more cups of cranberry juice will she need than lemonade?", "qid": "1034", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cups of cranberry juice and lemonade are needed to fill the 72 cup bowl.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of cups needed for the punch. We can do this by multiplying the number of cups of lemonade and cranberry juice needed to fill the bowl.\n\nThe image shows that 3 cups of lemonade are needed for every 5 cups of cranberry juice. So, to fill a 72 cup bowl, we would need:\n\n3 cups of lemonade for every 5 cups of cranberry juice\n72 cups in total\n\nSo, we need 72 / 5 = 14.4 cups of cranberry juice.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a cup, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of cups. This means we need 15 cups of cranberry juice.\n\nThe answer is 15 cups of cranberry juice needed than lemonade.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1034.png"}
