{"question": "Jawbreakers come in packages of 8. Sarah ate 20 Jawbreakers. How many Jawbreakers does she have left?", "qid": "1127", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many packages of 8 Jawbreakers Sarah has eaten. We can do this by dividing the number of Jawbreakers she ate by the number of Jawbreakers in a package.\n\n20 Jawbreakers \u00f7 8 Jawbreakers per package = 2.5 packages of Jawbreakers\n\nSince Sarah ate 2.5 packages of Jawbreakers, she has 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 packages of Jawbreakers left.\n\nTo find out how many Jawbreakers are left, we can multiply the number of Jawbreakers in a package by the number of packages left.\n\n0.5 packages \u00d7 8 Jawbreakers per package = 4 Jawbreakers left\n\nThe answer is 4 Jawbreakers.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1127.png"}
