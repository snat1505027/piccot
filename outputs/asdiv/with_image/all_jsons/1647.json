{"question": "Robin's hair was fifteen inches long. If she cut off five inches, how long is her hair now? ", "qid": "1647", "response": "First, we need to find the length of Robin's hair after cutting off five inches. We can do this by subtracting five inches from fifteen inches.\n\n15 inches - 5 inches = 10 inches\n\nNow, we need to find the length of Robin's hair in terms of feet. We know that one foot is equal to twelve inches.\n\n10 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.8333 feet\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a foot, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n0.8333 feet rounded to the nearest whole number is 1 foot.\n\nThe answer is 1 foot.", "answer": 10, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1647.png"}
