{"question": "A fence post in Tina's garden is 4 feet tall. When she measured the fence post's shadow, she found that it was 12 feet long. A tree in Tina's yard had a shadow of 72 feet. How tall is the tree?", "qid": "1026", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the image. We know that the fence post is 4 feet tall and its shadow is 12 feet long. We also know that the tree's shadow is 72 feet long.\n\nFirst, we need to find the ratio of the tree's height to its shadow length. To do this, we can divide the tree's shadow length by the fence post's shadow length:\n\n72 feet / 12 feet = 6 feet\n\nThis means that for every 12 feet of shadow length, the tree's height is 6 feet.\n\nNext, we need to find the tree's height. To do this, we can multiply the fence post's height by the ratio we found earlier:\n\n4 feet x 6 feet/12 feet = 3 feet\n\nThis means that the tree is 3 feet tall.\n\nThe answer is 3 feet.", "answer": 24, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1026.png"}
