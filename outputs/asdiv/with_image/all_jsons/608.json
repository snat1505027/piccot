{"question": "Mrs. Hilt bought a notebook for $1.30. She paid with nickels. How many nickels did she use to buy the notebook?", "qid": "608", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many nickels Mrs. Hilt used to buy the notebook. We know that the notebook cost $1.30, and we can see that there are 10 nickels in the image. We can use the information to set up an equation:\n\n1.30 (price of notebook) = x (number of nickels)\n\nNow, we can solve the equation by dividing the price of the notebook by the number of nickels:\n\n1.30 / 10 = x\n\nThe result of this division is 0.13. This means that Mrs. Hilt used 0.13 nickels to buy the notebook.\n\nThe answer is 0.13.", "answer": 26, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/608.png"}
