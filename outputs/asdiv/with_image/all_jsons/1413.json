{"question": "A store owner had two employees and bought nine hundred twenty-seven uniforms for them. If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?", "qid": "1413", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of uniforms the store owner should buy to ensure that each employee gets the same number of uniforms without any extra.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of uniforms the store owner already has. We know that he bought 927 uniforms, so the number of uniforms per employee is 927 \u00f7 2 = 463.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a uniform, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe store owner already has 463 uniforms, so he needs to buy 463 + 1 = 464 uniforms to ensure that each employee gets the same number of uniforms without any extra.\n\nThe answer is 464.", "answer": 1, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1413.png"}
