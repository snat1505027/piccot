{"question": "Ruth has 8 white buttons. She has 6 fewer brown buttons than white buttons. Ruth has 3 more gray buttons than brown buttons. How many buttons does Ruth have in all?", "qid": "636", "response": "First, we need to find the number of brown buttons Ruth has. Since she has 8 white buttons and 6 fewer brown buttons than white buttons, we can find the number of brown buttons by subtracting 6 from 8:\n\n8 - 6 = 2\n\nNext, we need to find the number of gray buttons Ruth has. She has 3 more gray buttons than brown buttons, so we can add 3 to the number of brown buttons:\n\n2 + 3 = 5\n\nNow, we can find Ruth's total number of buttons by adding the number of white buttons, brown buttons, and gray buttons:\n\n8 + 2 + 5 = 15\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/636.png"}
