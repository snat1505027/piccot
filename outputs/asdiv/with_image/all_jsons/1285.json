{"question": "The sum of the digits of a two number is 15. The number is decreased by 27 the digits are reversed. Find the number.", "qid": "1285", "response": "Step 1: The sum of the digits of a two number is 15.\nStep 2: Let's say the original number is x.\nStep 3: The number is decreased by 27, so the new number is x - 27.\nStep 4: The digits are reversed, so we need to find the reversed number.\nStep 5: To find the reversed number, we can use the following formula:\nreversed number = (x - 27) / 2 + 27\nStep 6: Now, we can substitute the value of x from step 3:\nreversed number = (x - 27) / 2 + 27\nStep 7: To find the original number, we can use the following formula:\noriginal number = reversed number \\* 2 + 27\nStep 8: Now, we can substitute the value of reversed number from step 5:\noriginal number = (x - 27) / 2 + 27 \\* 2 + 27\nStep 9: Simplify the expression:\noriginal number = x - 27 + 27 + 27\nStep 10: Combine the terms:\noriginal number = x + 27\nStep 11: The answer is x + 27.", "answer": 96, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1285.png"}
