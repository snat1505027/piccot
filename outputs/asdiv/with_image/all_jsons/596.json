{"question": "Jill invited 37 people to her birthday party. They each ate 8 pieces of pizza. How many pieces of pizza did they eat?", "qid": "596", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pieces of pizza eaten by all the guests.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of pieces of pizza eaten by each guest. Since there are 37 guests and each guest ate 8 pieces of pizza, we can find the total number of pieces of pizza eaten by all the guests by multiplying the number of guests by the number of pieces of pizza per guest:\n\n37 guests x 8 pieces of pizza per guest = 316 pieces of pizza eaten\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of pieces of pizza served at the party. We can do this by dividing the total number of pieces of pizza eaten by the number of guests:\n\n316 pieces of pizza eaten \u00f7 37 guests = 8.54 pieces of pizza per guest\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a piece of pizza, we need to round the number of pieces of pizza per guest to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up to 9 pieces of pizza per guest:\n\n8.54 pieces of pizza per guest \u00f7 37 guests = 234.48 pieces of pizza served\n\nTo find the total number of pieces of pizza served at the party, we can multiply the number of guests by the rounded number of pieces of pizza per guest:\n\n37 guests x 9 pieces of pizza per guest = 333 pieces of pizza served\n\nThe answer is 333 pieces of pizza served.", "answer": 296, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/596.png"}
