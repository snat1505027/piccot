{"question": "A pet shelter had twenty-three puppies when another two were brought in. If five puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?", "qid": "1984", "response": "First, we need to find the number of puppies in the shelter after the two new puppies were brought in. We can do this by adding the number of puppies before the new ones and the number of new puppies.\n\n23 + 2 = 25\n\nNext, we need to find the number of days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted if five puppies are adopted per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.\n\n25 / 5 = 5\n\nThe answer is 5 days.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1984.png"}
