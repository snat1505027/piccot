{"question": "A bicycle and a bicycle helmet cost 240 dollars. How much did each cost, if the bicycle cost 5 times as much as the helmet?", "qid": "1312", "response": "Let's start by finding the cost of the bicycle helmet. We know that the total cost is 240 dollars, and the helmet costs 5 times as much as the helmet. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nCost of a bicycle helmet = 240 / 5\n\nCost of a bicycle helmet = 48\n\nNow, we know that the bicycle costs 5 times as much as the helmet. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nCost of a bicycle = 5 x Cost of a bicycle helmet\n\nCost of a bicycle = 5 x 48\n\nCost of a bicycle = 240\n\nSince the total cost is 240 dollars, we can find the cost of the bicycle by dividing the total cost by the number of bicycles:\n\nCost of a bicycle = 240 / 1\n\nCost of a bicycle = 240\n\nThe answer is $240.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1312.png"}
