{"question": "There are some children at a bakery. As they were deciding what to buy, 24 girls came in and 31 boys left. If there are 78 children in the bakery in the end, how many children were there at first?", "qid": "660", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of children at the bakery and then subtract the number of girls and boys to find the initial number of children.\n\n1. We know that 24 girls and 31 boys came in, so the total number of children is 24 + 31 = 55.\n2. We also know that 78 children were at the bakery in the end, so we can subtract the number of girls and boys to find the initial number of children.\n\n55 - 24 (girls) - 31 (boys) = 78 - 24 - 31 = 23.\n\nThe answer is 23.", "answer": 85, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/660.png"}
