{"question": "The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also, nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number.", "qid": "1301", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the two-digit number whose digits sum to 9 and whose reversed digits give twice the original number.\n\nLet's start by looking at the equation:\n\n9 \u00d7 number = 2 \u00d7 reversed number\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the original number:\n\nnumber = 9 \u00d7 (reversed number) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the reversed number. To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Let's call the two-digit number \"AB\" (where A is the first digit and B is the second digit).\n\nThe sum of the digits of AB is 9, so we can write:\n\nA + B = 9\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find B:\n\nB = 9 - A\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for B in the original equation:\n\nnumber = 9 \u00d7 (9 - A) / 2\n\nnumber = 9 \u00d7 9 - 9 \u00d7 A\n\nnumber = 81 - 9A\n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out 9:\n\nnumber = 9 \u00d7 (9 - A)\n\nnumber = 81 - 9A\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for number in the original equation:\n\n9 \u00d7 (9 - A) = 2 \u00d7 (9 - A)\n\n9 \u00d7 9 - 9 \u00d7 A = 2 \u00d7 9 - 2 \u00d7 A\n\n81 - 9A = 18 - 2A\n\nNow we can solve for A:\n\n9A = 81 - 18\n\n9A = 63\n\nA = 63 / 9\n\nA = 7\n\nNow we can find B:\n\nB = 9 - A\n\nB = 9 - 7\n\nB = 2\n\nSo the two-digit number is 72.\n\nThe answer is 72.", "answer": 18, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1301.png"}
