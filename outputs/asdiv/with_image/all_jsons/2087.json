{"question": "Denise has 210 crayons and 3 blocks. If she shares the crayons among 30 friends, how many crayons does each friend get?", "qid": "2087", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crayons Denise has in total and then divide that number by the number of friends she has.\n\nDenise has 210 crayons and 3 blocks. We need to add the number of crayons in each block to the total number of crayons.\n\nThere are 3 blocks, and each block contains 20 crayons. So, the total number of crayons in the blocks is 3 x 20 = 60 crayons.\n\nNow, we add the total number of crayons in the blocks to the total number of crayons Denise has: 210 + 60 = 270 crayons.\n\nFinally, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of friends Denise has: 270 / 30 = 9 crayons.\n\nThe answer is 9 crayons.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2087.png"}
