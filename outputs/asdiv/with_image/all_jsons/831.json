{"question": "Zachary collects cans for the recycling club. On the first day, he found 4 cans. On the second day, he found 9 cans. He found 14 cans on the third day. If this pattern continues, how many cans do you  think Zachary will find on the seventh day?", "qid": "831", "response": "To find the number of cans Zachary will find on the seventh day, we need to find the pattern in the number of cans he found on each day.\n\nOn the first day, he found 4 cans.\nOn the second day, he found 9 cans.\nOn the third day, he found 14 cans.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the number of cans he finds increases by 5 on each day.\n\nTo find the number of cans on the seventh day, we need to add 5 to the number of cans he found on the sixth day.\n\nOn the sixth day, he found 19 cans.\n\nSo, on the seventh day, Zachary will find 19 + 5 = 24 cans.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 34, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/831.png"}
