{"question": "Pete, Bryan and Philip are cousins. Pete's age is one-third of Bryan and Philip is five years elder than Bryan. If the sum of the age of the cousins is 40, find the ages of each.", "qid": "1173", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the age of each cousin. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\n1. Pete's age is one-third of Bryan's age.\n2. Philip is five years older than Bryan.\n3. The sum of the ages of the cousins is 40.\n\nWe can use the information to create a system of equations:\n\n1. Pete's age = 1/3 Bryan's age\n2. Bryan's age + 5 = Philip's age\n3. Pete's age + Bryan's age + Philip's age = 40\n\nNow, let's solve the system of equations.\n\n1. Pete's age = 1/3 Bryan's age\n2. Bryan's age + 5 = Philip's age\n3. Pete's age + Bryan's age + Philip's age = 40\n\nFirst, we can solve equation 2 for Bryan's age:\nBryan's age = Philip's age - 5\n\nNext, we can substitute Bryan's age into equation 1 to find Pete's age:\nPete's age = 1/3 (Philip's age - 5)\n\nNow, we can substitute both Bryan's and Pete's ages into equation 3 to find Philip's age:\nPhilip's age = (1/3 (Philip's age - 5)) + Bryan's age + (Philip's age - 5)\n\nWe can simplify the equation by grouping terms:\nPhilip's age = 4/3 (Philip's age - 5) + 5\n\nWe can solve for Philip's age by dividing both sides by 4/3:\nPhilip's age = (4/3) (Philip's age - 5) + 5\nPhilip's age = (4/3) (Philip's age - 5) + 5\nPhilip's age = 4/3 (Philip's age - 5) + 5\n\nWe can simplify", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1173.png"}
