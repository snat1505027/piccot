{"question": "650 lollipops are to be distributed to 42 kids. If all the kids share all of the lollipops equally, at least how many more lollipops are needed?", "qid": "782", "response": "To find the number of lollipops needed for each kid, we need to divide the total number of lollipops by the number of kids.\n\n650 lollipops \u00f7 42 kids = 15.47 lollipops per kid\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a lollipop, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of lollipops.\n\n15.47 lollipops per kid \u2248 16 lollipops per kid\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more lollipops are needed to reach 16 lollipops per kid.\n\n650 lollipops - (42 kids \u00d7 16 lollipops) = 650 lollipops - 648 lollipops = 2 lollipops\n\nThe answer is 2 lollipops.", "answer": 22, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/782.png"}
