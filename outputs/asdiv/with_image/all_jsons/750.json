{"question": "There were 44 laptops in the shop, and Mike divided them equally into 5 rows. How many laptops are there in each row?", "qid": "750", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of laptops in each row. We know that there were 44 laptops in the shop and that they were divided equally into 5 rows.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of laptops in each row. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of laptops in each row = Total number of laptops / Number of rows\n\nIn this case, the total number of laptops is 44, and the number of rows is 5. So, we can calculate the number of laptops in each row as follows:\n\nNumber of laptops in each row = 44 / 5 = 8.8\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a laptop, we need to round the number of laptops in each row to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round 8.8 to 9, which means there are 9 laptops in each row.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/750.png"}
