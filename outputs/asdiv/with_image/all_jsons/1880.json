{"question": "Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving Cincinnati at the same time. One is biking 840 miles to Boston. The other is biking 440 miles to Atlanta. What is the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day?", "qid": "1880", "response": "To find the greatest number of miles a day each can bike, we need to find the average number of miles per day for both bicycle enthusiasts.\n\nLet's start by finding the total distance each person needs to cover:\n\nPerson 1: 840 miles\nPerson 2: 440 miles\n\nTotal distance: 840 + 440 = 1280 miles\n\nNow, we need to divide the total distance by the number of days they want to cover it. Let's assume they want to cover the distance in 5 days.\n\n1280 miles / 5 days = 256 miles per day\n\nSince both bicycle enthusiasts need to cover the same distance each day, we can say that the greatest number of miles a day each can bike is 256 miles.\n\nThe answer is 256 miles per day.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1880.png"}
