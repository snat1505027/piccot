{"question": "Lana's mom was buying extra school supplies for her and her siblings. If she bought three packs of glue sticks with seven glue sticks in each pack, how many did she get total?", "qid": "1544", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of glue sticks Lana's mom bought. We know that she bought three packs of glue sticks, and each pack contains seven glue sticks.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of glue sticks in the three packs. We can do this by multiplying the number of glue sticks in each pack by the number of packs:\n\n7 (glue sticks per pack) \\* 3 (packs) = 21 glue sticks\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of glue sticks Lana's mom bought. We can do this by adding the total number of glue sticks in the three packs to the number of glue sticks in the fourth pack:\n\n21 glue sticks (from the three packs) + 7 glue sticks (from the fourth pack) = 28 glue sticks\n\nThe answer is 28 glue sticks.", "answer": 21, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1544.png"}
