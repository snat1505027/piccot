{"question": "Melanie has pieces of train track that are 8 inches long that she is connecting together to form a track that her train can travel on. Martin is also trying to construct a track for his train but is using track pieces that are 20 inches long. How long will the shortest track be if the track that Melanie builds ends up being the same length as Martin's track?", "qid": "1861", "response": "To find the length of the shortest track, we need to find the common length between the two tracks.\n\nMelanie's track is 8 inches long, and Martin's track is 20 inches long.\n\nWe can find the common length by dividing the larger track length by the smaller track length:\n\n20 inches \u00f7 8 inches = 2.5 inches\n\nThe shortest track will be 2.5 inches long.\n\nThe answer is 2.5 inches.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1861.png"}
