{"question": "The library is 14.2 km away from Daniel's apartment. The bus takes Daniel 11.15 km of the way to the library. He has to walk the remaining distance. How many meters does Daniel have to walk?", "qid": "1044", "response": "To find the distance Daniel has to walk, we need to subtract the distance covered by the bus from the total distance to the library.\n\n14.2 km - 11.15 km = 3.05 km\n\nSince we know that 1 km is equal to 1000 meters, we can convert the distance to meters:\n\n3.05 km x 1000 meters/km = 3050 meters\n\nThe answer is 3050 meters.", "answer": 3050, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1044.png"}
