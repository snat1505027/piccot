{"question": "The wings now need to be heated. If the oven is at 150 degrees and the required temperature is 546 degrees, how many more degrees does the oven temperature need to increase?", "qid": "307", "response": "To find the difference between the current oven temperature and the required temperature, we can subtract 150 from 546.\n\n150 - 546 = -396\n\nSince the oven temperature needs to increase, we need to add the negative value to the current temperature.\n\n150 + (-396) = -246\n\nThe oven temperature needs to increase by 246 degrees to reach the required temperature of 546 degrees.\n\nThe answer is 246.", "answer": 396, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/307.png"}
