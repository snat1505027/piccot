{"question": "Each chocolate bar in a box cost $3. If a box had 9 bars total and Wendy sold all but 3 bars, how much money would she have made?", "qid": "2044", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the chocolate bars that Wendy sold and then subtract the cost of the 3 bars she didn't sell.\n\n1. First, we need to find the total cost of the 9 chocolate bars in the box. We can do this by multiplying the number of bars by their cost per bar: 9 bars x $3/bar = $<<9*3=27>>27.\n2. Next, we need to find the total cost of the 6 bars Wendy sold. We can do this by multiplying the number of bars she sold by their cost per bar: 6 bars x $3/bar = $<<6*3=18>>18.\n3. Finally, we need to subtract the cost of the 3 bars Wendy didn't sell from the total cost of the 9 bars in the box: $27 - $18 = $<<27-18=9>>9.\n\nThe answer is $9.", "answer": 18, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2044.png"}
