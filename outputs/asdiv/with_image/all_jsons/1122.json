{"question": "A school had 14 students sign up for the trivia teams. If they wanted to have 4 team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?", "qid": "1122", "response": "To find the number of students needed to sign up, we need to calculate the number of students per team and the total number of students required.\n\n1. Number of students per team: 14 students / 4 teams = 3.5 students per team\n2. Total number of students required: 3.5 students per team x 4 teams = 14 students\n\nSince the number of students needed is an integer, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 1 student more would need to sign up.\n\nThe answer is 15 students.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1122.png"}
