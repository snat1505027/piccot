{"question": "Sullivan Stationery sells cards in packs of 20 and envelopes in packs of 17. If Vera wants the same number of each, what is the minimum number of cards that she will have to buy?", "qid": "1843", "response": "To find the minimum number of cards, we need to find the number of envelopes Vera will have to buy first. We know that envelopes come in packs of 17.\n\n1. We can find the number of envelopes Vera will have to buy by dividing the number of cards she wants by the number of cards per pack (20).\n\n2. Since Vera wants the same number of each, we can find the number of packs of cards she will have to buy by dividing the number of cards she wants by the number of cards per pack (20).\n\n3. To find the number of packs of envelopes she will have to buy, we can divide the number of envelopes she will have by the number of envelopes per pack (17).\n\n4. To find the total number of cards, we can multiply the number of packs of cards by the number of cards per pack.\n\n5. To find the total number of envelopes, we can multiply the number of packs of envelopes by the number of envelopes per pack.\n\nThe answer is 20 packs of cards and 17 packs of envelopes.", "answer": 340, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1843.png"}
