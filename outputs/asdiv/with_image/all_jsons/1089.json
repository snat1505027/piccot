{"question": "To encourage public transportation, Russom wants to give some friends envelopes with bus tickets and subway tickets in them. If he has 18 bus tickets and 12 subway tickets to split equally among the envelopes, and wants no tickets left over, what is the greatest number of envelopes Russom can make?", "qid": "1089", "response": "To find the greatest number of envelopes, we need to distribute the bus tickets and subway tickets equally among the envelopes. Let's start by dividing the bus tickets equally among the envelopes. Since there are 18 bus tickets and we want to distribute them equally, we can divide them by the number of envelopes:\n\n18 bus tickets \u00f7 number of envelopes = 18 \u00f7 x\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest number of envelopes that can be created by dividing the subway tickets equally. Since there are 12 subway tickets and we want to distribute them equally, we can divide them by the number of envelopes:\n\n12 subway tickets \u00f7 number of envelopes = 12 \u00f7 x\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n18 \u00f7 x = x\n12 \u00f7 x = x\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously by multiplying both sides of the first equation by 12 and both sides of the second equation by 18:\n\n18x = 12x\n\nNow, we can add 6x to both sides:\n\n24x = 12x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 6:\n\n4x = 12x\n\nNow, we can add 2x to both sides:\n\n6x = 12x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 2:\n\n3x = 12x\n\nNow, we can add 3x to both sides:\n\n6x = 12x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\n2x = 12x\n\nNow, we can add 2x to both sides:\n\n4x = 12x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 4:\n\n1x = 12x\n\nNow, we can add 1x to both sides:\n\n1x = 12x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 1:\n\n1x = 12x\n\nSince x is equal to the number of envelopes, we can substitute x for the number of envelopes in the first equation:\n\n18", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1089.png"}
