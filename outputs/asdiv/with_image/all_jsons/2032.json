{"question": "There are fifty-eight students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If twenty-eight of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into five groups, how many students would be in each group?", "qid": "2032", "response": "First, we need to find the number of students who didn't get picked for the team. We can do this by subtracting the number of students trying out from the total number of students.\n\n508 students trying out - 28 students not picked = 480 students\n\nNext, we need to divide the number of students who were not picked by the number of groups to find the number of students in each group.\n\n480 students / 5 groups = 96 students per group\n\nThe answer is 96 students per group.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2032.png"}
