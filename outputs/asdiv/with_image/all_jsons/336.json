{"question": "They also prepared some chips. If he prepared 350 grams of chips and his father prepared 268 grams, how much chips should his brother prepare if they are to have 800 grams of chips?", "qid": "336", "response": "First, we need to find the total amount of chips prepared by the father and the son. We can do this by adding the amount of chips prepared by the father and the son.\n\n350 grams (son) + 268 grams (father) = 618 grams (total)\n\nNext, we need to find the difference between the total amount of chips and the desired amount of chips.\n\n800 grams (desired) - 618 grams (total) = 182 grams\n\nSince the son prepared 350 grams of chips and the father prepared 268 grams, the son should prepare 182 grams more to reach the desired amount of 800 grams.\n\n182 grams (more) = 532 grams (total)\n\nThe answer is 532 grams.", "answer": 182, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/336.png"}
