{"question": "A sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes and comes back in 1 hour. Determine the speed of the sailor in still water and the speed of current.", "qid": "1290", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the sailor's speed in still water and the speed of the current. We can use the information provided in the image to set up a system of equations.\n\nLet's start by finding the sailor's speed in still water. We know that the sailor travels 8 km downstream in 40 minutes, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nSailor's speed in still water = Distance / Time\nSailor's speed in still water = 8 km / 40 minutes\nSailor's speed in still water = 0.2 km/min\n\nNext, we need to find the speed of the current. We know that the sailor travels 8 km downstream in 40 minutes and comes back in 1 hour. This means that the sailor travels a total of 8 km in 50 minutes, which includes the time spent going downstream and coming back. We can set up the following equation to find the speed of the current:\n\nSpeed of current = Distance / Time\nSpeed of current = 8 km / 50 minutes\nSpeed of current = 0.16 km/min\n\nThe answer is:\n\nSailor's speed in still water: 0.2 km/min\nSpeed of current: 0.16 km/min", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1290.png"}
