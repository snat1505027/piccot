{"question": "Cody made 12 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he charged 4 bucks for each lawn, how many lawns did he mow?", "qid": "1588", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of lawns Cody mowed. We know that he made $12 and charged $4 per lawn. Let's start by setting up an equation:\n\n12 (dollars earned) = 4 (dollars per lawn) \u00d7 (number of lawns)\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of lawns:\n\n12 = 4 \u00d7 (number of lawns)\n\nTo find the number of lawns, we can divide both sides by 4:\n\n12 \u00f7 4 = (number of lawns) \u00f7 4\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n3 = (number of lawns) \u00f7 4\n\nTo find the number of lawns, we can multiply both sides by 4:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = (number of lawns)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n12 = (number of lawns)\n\nSince the answer is not a whole number, we can round it down to the nearest whole number. The answer is 12.\n\nThe answer is 12.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1588.png"}
