{"question": "If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day, how many days does he need to fix the watches?", "qid": "734", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of watches that Tom needs to fix. We can do this by multiplying the number of watches per day by the total number of watches to be fixed.\n\n12 watches per day \u00d7 158 watches to be fixed = 1904 watches\n\nNow, we need to find the number of days it would take to fix all the watches. To do this, we can divide the total number of watches by the number of watches per day.\n\n1904 watches \u00f7 12 watches per day = 160.3333 days\n\nSince we cannot fix a fraction of a day, we need to round up the number of days to the nearest whole number.\n\n160.3333 days \u2248 161 days\n\nThe answer is 161 days.", "answer": 14, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/734.png"}
