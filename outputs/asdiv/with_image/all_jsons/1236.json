There are now 90 peaches at the stand, how many did he pick ?", "qid": "1236", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of peaches Jason picked from the orchard. Let's start by using the information we have:\n\n1. Jason had 27 peaches left at his fruit stand.\n2. He picked more peaches from the orchard.\n3. There are now 90 peaches at the stand.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\n27 + picked peaches = 90\n\nNow, we need to solve for the number of peaches Jason picked. To do this, we can subtract 27 from 90:\n\n90 - 27 = 63\n\nThe answer is 63.", "answer": 63, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1236.png"}
