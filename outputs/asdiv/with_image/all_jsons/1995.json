{"question": "At the town carnival Billy rode the ferris wheel seven times and the bumper cars three times. If each ride cost five tickets, how many tickets did he use?", "qid": "1995", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tickets Billy used for all the rides.\n\n1. We know that Billy rode the ferris wheel seven times, so we can write 7 as the number of rides for the ferris wheel.\n2. We know that Billy rode the bumper cars three times, so we can write 3 as the number of rides for the bumper cars.\n3. We need to find the total number of tickets Billy used for all the rides. To do this, we can add the number of tickets used for the ferris wheel and the number of tickets used for the bumper cars.\n4. The number of tickets used for the ferris wheel is 7 x 5 = 35.\n5. The number of tickets used for the bumper cars is 3 x 5 = 15.\n6. To find the total number of tickets used, we add the number of tickets used for the ferris wheel and the number of tickets used for the bumper cars: 35 + 15 = 50.\n\nThe answer is 50.", "answer": 50, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1995.png"}
