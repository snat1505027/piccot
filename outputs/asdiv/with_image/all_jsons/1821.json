{"question": "Mrs. Evans has 120 crayons and 30 pieces of paper to give to her students. What is the largest number of students she can have in her class so that each student gets equal number of crayons and equal number of paper?", "qid": "1821", "response": "To find the largest number of students Mrs. Evans can have in her class, we need to find the largest number that can be divided equally by 120 and 30.\n\nFirst, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 120 and 30, which is 600.\n\nNext, we can divide 600 by 120 and 30 to find the largest number of students:\n\n600 \u00f7 120 = 5\n600 \u00f7 30 = 20\n\nSince the number of students must be a multiple of both 120 and 30, the largest number of students Mrs. Evans can have in her class is 20.\n\nThe answer is 20.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1821.png"}
