{"question": "Kim has 4 cousins. She wants to give each one 5 pieces of gum. How much gum will she need?", "qid": "169", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pieces of gum needed for all 4 cousins.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of pieces of gum per cousin. We can do this by dividing the number of cousins by the number of pieces of gum per cousin.\n\n4 cousins / 5 pieces of gum per cousin = 0.8 pieces of gum per cousin\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of pieces of gum needed for all 4 cousins. We can do this by multiplying the number of pieces of gum per cousin by the total number of cousins.\n\n0.8 pieces of gum per cousin \\* 4 cousins = 3.2 pieces of gum needed\n\nSince the answer is not an integer, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n3.2 pieces of gum needed \u2248 4 pieces of gum needed\n\nThe answer is 4 pieces of gum needed.", "answer": 20, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/169.png"}
