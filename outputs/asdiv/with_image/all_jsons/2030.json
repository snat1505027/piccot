{"question": "The cafeteria had fifty-one apples. For lunch they handed out forty-one to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes five apples, how many pies could they make?", "qid": "2030", "response": "To find out how many pies they can make, we need to use the apples that were not handed out to the students. We can do this by subtracting the number of apples given to students (41) from the total number of apples (51).\n\n51 - 41 = 10\n\nSince each pie takes five apples, we can divide the number of apples by the number of apples per pie to find out how many pies can be made.\n\n10 \u00f7 5 = 2\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2030.png"}
