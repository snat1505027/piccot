{"question": "Rupert and Ronald aced their math test. So their mother bought for them a wonderful trampoline yesterday. Ronald jumped 157 times on the trampoline. Rupert jumped 86 more times than Ronald. How many times did they jump altogether?", "qid": "615", "response": "To find the total number of jumps for both Rupert and Ronald, we need to add the number of jumps for each of them.\n\nRupert jumped 86 more times than Ronald, so we can find the difference between their jumps by subtracting Ronald's jumps from Rupert's jumps:\n\n86 = Rupert's jumps - Ronald's jumps\n\nNow we can add the number of jumps for both Rupert and Ronald to find the total number of jumps:\n\nTotal number of jumps = Rupert's jumps + Ronald's jumps\nTotal number of jumps = 86 + 157\n\nThe answer is 243.", "answer": 400, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/615.png"}
