{"question": "Tayli wishes to advertise her business, so she gives packs of 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner and sets of 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner. At the end of the day, Tayli realizes that she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers. What is the minimum number of flyers of each color she distributed? ", "qid": "1813", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of flyers of each color that Tayli distributed. Let's start by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Tayli gave out 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner.\n2. Tayli gave out 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner.\n\nWe know that Tayli distributed the same number of red and blue flyers. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:\n\n13 (red flyers) = 20 (blue flyers)\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation to find the minimum number of flyers of each color. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 13:\n\n1 (red flyers) = 20 (blue flyers) / 13\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 20:\n\n1/20 (red flyers) = 13/20 (blue flyers)\n\nWe can further simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 20:\n\n1 (red flyers) = 13 (blue flyers)\n\nSince we are looking for the minimum number of flyers, we can round down the number of red flyers to 1 and the number of blue flyers to 13.\n\nThe minimum number of red flyers Tayli distributed is 1.\nThe minimum number of blue flyers Tayli distributed is 13.\n\nThe answer is: Tayli distributed a minimum of 1 red flyer and 13 blue flyers.", "answer": 260, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1813.png"}
