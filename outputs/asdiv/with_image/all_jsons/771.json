{"question": "Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how much of the original ribbon was left?", "qid": "771", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces that can be cut from the ribbon. We know that each piece is 73 cm long, and we want to find the number of pieces that can be cut from the 3,730 cm long ribbon.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the length of the ribbon from centimeters to meters. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so we can divide the length of the ribbon by 100 to get the length in meters:\n\n3,730 cm \u00f7 100 = 37.3 meters\n\nNext, we can find the number of pieces that can be cut from the ribbon by dividing the length of the ribbon by the length of each piece:\n\n37.3 meters \u00f7 73 cm = 507 pieces\n\nSince we cannot cut a fraction of a piece, we need to round up the number of pieces to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up to 510 pieces.\n\nNow, we can find the length of the remaining ribbon by subtracting the length of the pieces from the original length of the ribbon:\n\n3,730 cm - (510 pieces \u00d7 73 cm) = 3,220 cm\n\nFinally, we can convert the length of the remaining ribbon back to meters:\n\n3,220 cm \u00f7 100 = 32.2 meters\n\nThe answer is 32.2 meters.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/771.png"}
