{"question": "Paul bought six boxes of chocolate candy and four boxes of caramel candy. If each box has nine pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total?", "qid": "1997", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy Paul has. We can do this by adding the number of pieces in each box of chocolate candy and the number of pieces in each box of caramel candy.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of pieces of chocolate candy. There are six boxes of chocolate candy, and each box has nine pieces. So, the total number of pieces of chocolate candy is 6 x 9 = <<6*9=54>>54.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of pieces of caramel candy. There are four boxes of caramel candy, and each box has nine pieces. So, the total number of pieces of caramel candy is 4 x 9 = <<4*9=36>>36.\n\nNow, we can add the total number of pieces of chocolate candy and the total number of pieces of caramel candy to find the total number of pieces of candy Paul has. The total number of pieces of candy is 54 + 36 = <<54+36=90>>90.\n\nThe answer is 90.", "answer": 90, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1997.png"}
