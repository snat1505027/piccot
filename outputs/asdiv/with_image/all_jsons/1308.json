{"question": "If 28 less than five times a certain number is 232. What is the number?", "qid": "1308", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number that, when multiplied by 5, gives 232 when 28 is subtracted from it.\n\nLet's start by using the equation: 5x - 28 = 232\n\nNext, we can simplify the equation by moving the 28 to the left side: 5x = 232 + 28\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 5: x = (232 + 28) / 5\n\nFinally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2: x = 232 + 28 / 5\n\nThe answer is 232 + 28 / 5.", "answer": 52, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1308.png"}
