{"question": "There was 1,050 ml of tea in a pot. Anna poured the tea into some cups. If there were 65 ml of tea in each cup, how many cups were filled with tea?", "qid": "778", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cups were filled with tea. We know that there were 1,050 ml of tea in the pot and 65 ml of tea in each cup. We can start by dividing the total amount of tea by the amount of tea in each cup.\n\n1,050 ml \u00f7 65 ml = 16.15 cups\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a cup, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of cups.\n\n16.15 cups \u2248 16 cups\n\nThe answer is 16 cups.", "answer": 16, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/778.png"}
