{"question": "A box of apples was delivered to Paul's Pies and Cakes. He put half of the apples aside for a pie he would make later. He put 25 of the remaining apples in the refrigerator. That left 6 apples to use in his muffins. How many apples were in the box at first?", "qid": "845", "response": "The problem states that Paul put half of the apples aside for a pie, so we need to find the number of apples that were initially in the box. Let's start by finding the number of apples for the pie.\n\nHalf of the apples = 1/2 \\* x\n\nSince Paul put 25 apples in the refrigerator, we can find the number of apples for the pie by subtracting the number of apples in the refrigerator from the initial number of apples.\n\n1/2 \\* x - 25 = 6\n\nNow, we need to solve for x.\n\n1/2 \\* x - 25 = 6\n\n25 - 6 = 19\n\n1/2 \\* x = 19\n\nx = 19 \\* 2 = 38\n\nThere were 38 apples in the box at first.\n\nThe answer is 38.", "answer": 62, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/845.png"}
