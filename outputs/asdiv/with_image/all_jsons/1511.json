{"question": "A recipe called for the ratio of sugar to flour to be 10:1. If you used 50 ounce of sugar, how many ounces of flour would you need to use?", "qid": "1511", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the equivalent amount of flour needed based on the given ratio.\n\n1. First, we need to find the equivalent of 10 ounces of sugar. Since we know that 10:1 means 10 parts sugar to 1 part flour, we can find the equivalent of 10 ounces of sugar by dividing it by 10.\n\n10 ounces of sugar \u00f7 10 = 1 ounce of sugar\n\n2. Now, we know that we used 50 ounces of sugar. To find the equivalent amount of flour, we need to multiply the amount of sugar by the ratio (10:1).\n\n50 ounces of sugar \u00d7 10:1 = 500 ounces of flour\n\n3. Since we have found the equivalent amount of flour, we can now convert it to ounces.\n\n500 ounces of flour \u00f7 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound) = 31.25 ounces of flour\n\nThe answer is 31.25 ounces of flour.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1511.png"}
