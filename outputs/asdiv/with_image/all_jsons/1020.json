{"question": "The ratio of boys to girls at the basketball game is 8:5. There are 30 girls. How many more boys are there than girls?", "qid": "1020", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boys. We know that the ratio of boys to girls is 8:5, and there are 30 girls. We can use the cross-multiplication method to find the number of boys.\n\nFirst, we multiply the number of girls by 8 to find the number of boys: 30 girls x 8 = 240 boys.\n\nNext, we divide the number of girls by 5 to find the number of boys: 30 girls \u00f7 5 = 6 boys.\n\nSince the answer is not 240 or 6, we can conclude that the answer is not among the given options. The answer is 240 boys.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1020.png"}
