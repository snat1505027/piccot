{"question": "The school cafeteria serves tacos every sixth day and cheeseburgers every eighth day. If tacos and cheeseburgers are both on today's menu, how many days will it be before they are both on the menu again?", "qid": "1865", "response": "To find the number of days until both tacos and cheeseburgers are on the menu again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the numbers by dividing both by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.\n\n6 / 2 = 3\n8 / 2 = 4\n\nNow, we can find the LCM by multiplying the two numbers:\n\nLCM(3, 4) = 12\n\nThe answer is 12 days.", "answer": 24, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1865.png"}
