{"question": "The sum of present age of Abe and the age before 7 years is 31. Find the present age of Abe.", "qid": "1180", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. The sum of the present age of Abe and the age before 7 years is 31. We can represent this as:\n\nPresent age of Abe + Age before 7 years = 31\n\nSince we know that the age before 7 years is equal to 7 minus the present age of Abe, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nPresent age of Abe + (7 - Present age of Abe) = 31\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n2 \\* Present age of Abe = 31 - 7\n\nPresent age of Abe = (31 - 7) / 2\n\nPresent age of Abe = 24\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 19, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1180.png"}
