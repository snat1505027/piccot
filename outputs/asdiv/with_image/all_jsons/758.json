{"question": "There are 32 students in the class. The teacher divided them into 5 equal groups. How many students are there in each group?", "qid": "758", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in each group. We know that there are 32 students in the class and the teacher divided them into 5 equal groups.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of students in the class. We can do this by multiplying the number of groups by the number of students in each group.\n\n32 students in the class \u00f7 5 groups = 6.4 students per group\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n6.4 students per group \u00f7 1 = 6 students per group\n\nThe answer is 6 students per group.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/758.png"}
