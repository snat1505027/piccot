{"question": "The weight of 4 cakes is 800 g. The total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g. How much heavier is a cake than a piece of bread?", "qid": "796", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the weight difference between a cake and a piece of bread.\n\nFirst, we need to find the weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread. We can do this by adding the weight of 3 cakes (800 g) and 5 pieces of bread (500 g).\n\n800 g + 500 g = 1300 g\n\nNow, we need to find the weight difference between a cake and a piece of bread. To do this, we can subtract the weight of a piece of bread (500 g) from the weight of a cake (800 g).\n\n800 g - 500 g = 300 g\n\nThe weight difference between a cake and a piece of bread is 300 g.\n\nThe answer is 300 g.", "answer": 100, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/796.png"}
