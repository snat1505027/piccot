{"question": "A teacher is to arrange 60 boys and 72 girls in rows. He wishes to arrange them in such a way that only boys or girls will be there in a row. Find the greatest number of students that could be arranged in a row.", "qid": "1883", "response": "To find the greatest number of students that could be arranged in a row, we need to find the maximum number of students that can be accommodated in a row while maintaining the condition that only boys or girls are present in a row.\n\nLet's start by considering the number of boys and girls separately.\n\n1. Boys:\nThe number of boys is 60. To arrange them in a row, we need to divide 60 by the greatest possible divisor that is a factor of 60. The greatest possible divisor of 60 is 60 itself. Therefore, the maximum number of boys that can be arranged in a row is 60.\n\n2. Girls:\nThe number of girls is 72. To arrange them in a row, we need to divide 72 by the greatest possible divisor that is a factor of 72. The greatest possible divisor of 72 is 72 itself. Therefore, the maximum number of girls that can be arranged in a row is 72.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of students that can be arranged in a row by combining the maximum number of boys and girls. The maximum number of students that can be arranged in a row is the maximum number of boys (60) plus the maximum number of girls (72).\n\nThe answer is 60 + 72 = 132.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1883.png"}
