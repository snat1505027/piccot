{"question": "A fruit salad made on a TV cooking program requires chunks of cantaloupe and honeydew. What is the greatest number of servings you can make using all of the fruit if you have 30 chunks of cantaloupe and 42 chunks of honeydew?", "qid": "1881", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest number of servings we can make using all the fruit. We have 30 chunks of cantaloupe and 42 chunks of honeydew.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of chunks of fruit. We can do this by adding the number of chunks of cantaloupe and honeydew:\n\n30 chunks of cantaloupe + 42 chunks of honeydew = 72 chunks of fruit\n\nNext, we need to find the greatest number of servings we can make using all the fruit. We can do this by dividing the total number of chunks of fruit by the number of chunks per serving.\n\n72 chunks of fruit \u00f7 3 chunks per serving = 24 servings\n\nThe answer is 24 servings.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1881.png"}
