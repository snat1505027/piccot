{"question": "Robin is making bead necklaces. She wants to use 31 beads to make 4 necklaces. If she wants each necklace to have the same number of beads, how many beads will she have left over?", "qid": "1123", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of beads Robin will have after making 4 necklaces with 31 beads each.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of beads in 4 necklaces. We can do this by multiplying the number of beads per necklace by the number of necklaces:\n\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of beads Robin will have left over. To do this, we can subtract the total number of beads used from the total number of beads available:\n\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces = 124 beads\n31 beads per necklace \\* 4 necklaces =", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1123.png"}
