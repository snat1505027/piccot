{"question": "Steven and Megan shared some marbles in the ratio 3:4. Megan received 24 marbles. How many marbles did Steven get?", "qid": "1025", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of marbles Steven received. We know that Megan received 24 marbles, and the ratio of marbles shared between Steven and Megan is 3:4.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of marbles they shared. To do this, we multiply the number of marbles received by Megan (24) by the number of marbles in the 4:3 ratio (4).\n\n24 marbles received by Megan \\* 4 marbles in the 4:3 ratio = 96 marbles shared between Steven and Megan\n\nNow, we need to find the number of marbles Steven received. Since the ratio is 3:4, we can find this by dividing the total number of marbles shared (96) by 4.\n\n96 marbles shared / 4 = 24 marbles received by Steven\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1025.png"}
