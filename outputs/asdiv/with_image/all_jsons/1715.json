We can use the information provided in the image to do this.\n\n1. Oliver got seventy-eight pounds of candy.\n2. After giving some to Janet, he had sixty-eight pounds left.\n\nLet's start by finding out how many pounds of candy Oliver initially had. We can do this by adding the number of pounds he gave to Janet to the number of pounds he had left.\n\n78 (initial candy) + 68 (candy left) = 146 pounds\n\nNow, we know that Oliver initially had 146 pounds of candy. To find out how many pounds he gave to Janet, we can subtract the number of pounds he had left from the initial amount of candy.\n\n146 (initial candy) - 68 (candy left) = 78 pounds\n\nThe answer is 78 pounds.", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1715.png"}
