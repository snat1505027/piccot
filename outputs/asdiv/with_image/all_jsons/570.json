{"question": "White t-shirts can be purchased in packages of 6. If Mom buys 71 packages, how many white t-shirts will she have?", "qid": "570", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white t-shirts Mom will have if she buys 71 packages.\n\n1. We know that white t-shirts can be purchased in packages of 6.\n2. We can find the number of white t-shirts in one package by dividing the number of packages by 6.\n\n71 packages \u00f7 6 packages/t-shirt = 11.83 packages of white t-shirts\n\n1. Since we cannot have a fraction of a package, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of packages.\n\n11.83 packages rounded up to the nearest whole number of packages = 12 packages\n\n2. To find the number of white t-shirts in 12 packages, we multiply the number of packages by the number of t-shirts in each package.\n\n12 packages \u00d7 6 t-shirts/package = 72 white t-shirts\n\nThe answer is 72 white t-shirts.", "answer": 426, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/570.png"}
