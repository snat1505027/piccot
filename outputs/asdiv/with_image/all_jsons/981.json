{"question": "Sandra is sorting pencils into boxes. She put 78 pencils in the first box, 87 pencils in the second box, 96 pencils in the third box, and 105 pencils in the fourth box. If this pattern continues, how many pencils will Sandra put in the fifth box?", "qid": "981", "response": "To find the number of pencils in the fifth box, we need to find the pattern that Sandra is following. Let's analyze the given numbers:\n\n1. 78 pencils in the first box\n2. 87 pencils in the second box\n3. 96 pencils in the third box\n4. 105 pencils in the fourth box\n\nWe can see that the difference between the number of pencils in each subsequent box is 9. To find the number of pencils in the fifth box, we need to add 9 to the number of pencils in the fourth box:\n\n105 + 9 = 114\n\nThe answer is 114.", "answer": 114, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/981.png"}
