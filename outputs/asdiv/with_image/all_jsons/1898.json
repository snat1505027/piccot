{"question": "Amy worked as a sacker at the grocery store where she made $2/hr. If she worked for 7 hours and also made $9 in tips, how much money did she earn?", "qid": "1898", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Amy earned. We know that she worked for 7 hours and earned $2 per hour, so we can calculate her hourly wage by dividing the amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.\n\n$2/hr \\* 7 hours = $<<2/hr\\*7=14>>14\n\nNext, we know that she also made $9 in tips. We can add this amount to her hourly wage to find her total earnings.\n\n$14 + $9 = $<<14+9=23>>23\n\nThe answer is $23.", "answer": 23, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1898.png"}
