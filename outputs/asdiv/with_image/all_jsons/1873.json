{"question": "On a track for remote-controlled racing cars, racing car A completes the track in 28 seconds, while racing car B completes it in 24 seconds. If they both start at the same time, after how many seconds will they be side by side again?", "qid": "1873", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in time between the two racing cars. We can do this by subtracting the time taken by racing car B from the time taken by racing car A.\n\n28 seconds - 24 seconds = 4 seconds\n\nNow, we need to find the number of seconds that racing car B needs to catch up to racing car A. To do this, we can divide the difference in time by the time it takes for racing car B to complete the track.\n\n4 seconds \u00f7 24 seconds = 0.1667 seconds\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a second, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number.\n\n0.1667 seconds \u2248 1 second\n\nSo, racing car B needs to complete the track in approximately 1 second more than racing car A to be side by side again.\n\nThe answer is 1 second.", "answer": 168, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1873.png"}
