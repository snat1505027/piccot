Write algebraic equation and find the number.", "qid": "1187", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the algebraic equation: Let x be the number.\n\n3x + 2 = 24\n\n2. Move the 2 to the left side of the equation:\n\n3x = 24 - 2\n\n3. Divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = (24 - 2) / 3\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n\nx = 8\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1187.png"}
