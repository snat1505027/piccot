{"question": "There are 757 pounds of sand to be filled into bags. If each bag has a capacity of 65 pounds, how many bags are needed?", "qid": "722", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bags are needed to hold 757 pounds of sand, given that each bag has a capacity of 65 pounds.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many pounds of sand can be held in one bag. To do this, we can divide the total capacity of the bags (757 pounds) by the capacity of each bag (65 pounds).\n\n757 pounds \u00f7 65 pounds = 11.64 bags\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of bags.\n\n11.64 bags \u2248 12 bags\n\nTherefore, we need 12 bags to hold 757 pounds of sand.\n\nThe answer is 12 bags.", "answer": 12, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/722.png"}
