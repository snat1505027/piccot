{"question": "The ratio of the length of Joey's rope to Chad's rope is 8:3. Joey's rope is 56 cm long. How long is Chad's rope?", "qid": "1030", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of Chad's rope. We know that the ratio of Joey's rope to Chad's rope is 8:3, and Joey's rope is 56 cm long.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of Chad's rope in terms of Joey's rope. We can do this by dividing Chad's rope length by Joey's rope length:\n\nChad's rope length = Joey's rope length / 3\n\nNext, we can substitute the value of Joey's rope length into the equation:\n\nChad's rope length = 56 cm / 3\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nChad's rope length = 18.67 cm\n\nThe answer is 18.67 cm.", "answer": 21, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1030.png"}
