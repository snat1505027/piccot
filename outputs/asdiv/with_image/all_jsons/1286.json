{"question": "In a two digit number, the tens digit is three times the unit digit. When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. Find the number.", "qid": "1286", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:\n\n1. Understand the given information:\n   - In a two-digit number, the tens digit is three times the unit digit.\n   - When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed.\n2. Let's call the original number \"x\".\n3. Since the tens digit is three times the unit digit, we can write the original number as \"x3y\", where x is the tens digit and y is the unit digit.\n4. To find the number when the digits are reversed, we need to subtract 54 from the original number. So, the reversed number would be \"x3y - 54\".\n5. Now, we need to find the original number when the digits are reversed. To do this, we can add 54 to the reversed number. So, the original number when the digits are reversed would be \"x3y + 54\".\n6. We can now substitute the values of x and y from the original number \"x3y\" into the equation \"x3y + 54\".\n7. Solve the equation for x and y.\n\nThe answer is x3y + 54 = x3(y + 54).", "answer": 93, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1286.png"}
