{"question": "Finally, they had to roam around 169 factories to make sure they are throwing their wastes properly. If their group went to 69 factories and the second went to 52, how many factories remain unchecked?", "qid": "334", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of factories checked by both groups. We can do this by adding the number of factories checked by the first group (69) and the second group (52).\n\n69 + 52 = 121\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of factories in the image. We can do this by adding the number of factories checked by the first group and the second group to the number of factories checked by the third group.\n\n69 + 52 + 52 = 173\n\nSince the total number of factories checked is 173, and the total number of factories in the image is 173, all factories have been checked.\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 48, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/334.png"}
