{"question": "There are 13 different books in the 'Crazy Silly School' series. If you read 9 of the books, how many more do you still have to read?", "qid": "1580", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total number of books in the series and the number of books the person has read.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of books the person has read. In the image, there is a number 9 written in the middle.\n2. Next, we need to find the total number of books in the series. The image shows the number 13, which represents the total number of books in the series.\n3. Now, we can find the difference between the two numbers. To do this, we subtract the number of books read (9) from the total number of books in the series (13).\n\n9 - 13 = -4\n\n1. Since the result is negative, we need to add the number back to the total number of books to get the correct answer.\n\n13 + 9 = 22\n\nThe answer is 22.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1580.png"}
