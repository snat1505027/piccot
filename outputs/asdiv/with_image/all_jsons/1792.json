{"question": "At the schools book fair Sam bought 13 adventure books and 17 mystery books. If 15 of the books were used, how many new books did he buy? ", "qid": "1792", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of books Sam bought and the number of used books. We can then find the number of new books he bought by subtracting the number of used books from the total number of books.\n\n1. We know that Sam bought 13 adventure books and 17 mystery books. Let's call the total number of books Sam bought \"x\".\n2. We can represent the number of used books as \"15u\" (15 used books).\n3. We can represent the number of new books Sam bought as \"x - 15u\" (x minus 15 used books).\n4. To find the value of \"x\", we need to add the number of adventure books and the number of mystery books:\nx = 13 + 17\nx = 30\n5. Now we can substitute the value of \"x\" into the equation for the number of new books:\nx - 15u = 30 - 15\nx - 15u = 15\n6. To find the value of \"15u\", we can solve the equation:\n15u = 15\nu = 1\n7. Now we can find the number of new books Sam bought by substituting the value of \"u\" into the equation for the number of new books:\nx - 15u = 30 - 15\nx - 15u = 15\nx - 15 = 15\nx = 30\n8. The answer is 30.", "answer": 15, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1792.png"}
