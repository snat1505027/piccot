", "qid": "1727", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of cherries the chef had before making the pie and the number of cherries he has left.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of cherries the chef used to make the pie. We know that he used thirty-nine cherries to make the pie.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of cherries he has left. We know that he has fifty-eight cherries left.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the two numbers by subtracting the number of cherries used from the number of cherries left.\n\nThe difference is fifty-eight cherries - thirty-nine cherries = 19 cherries.\n\nThe answer is 19 cherries.", "answer": 97, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1727.png"}
