{"question": "Linda buys strawberry gum in packs of 6 pieces and blueberry gum in packs of 5 pieces. If Linda wants to buy the same amount of each type of gum, what is the smallest number of pieces of each flavor that she must buy?", "qid": "1100", "response": "To find the smallest number of pieces of each flavor, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of pieces in each pack.\n\nThe number of pieces in a pack of strawberry gum is 6, and the number of pieces in a pack of blueberry gum is 5.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of each number:\n\n6 = 2^2 \\* 3\n5 = 5^1\n\nNext, we multiply the prime factors to find the LCM:\n\nLCM(6, 5) = 2^2 \\* 5^1 = 10\n\nSo, Linda must buy at least 10 pieces of each flavor to buy the same amount of each type of gum.\n\nThe answer is 10.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1100.png"}
