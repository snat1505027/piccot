{"question": "Robin bought 11 sodas for her and her friends. If they only drank 3 of them, how many extras did she have?", "qid": "1632", "response": "First, we need to find the number of sodas Robin bought. We know that she bought 11 sodas.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of sodas that were drunk. We know that 3 sodas were drunk.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of sodas bought and the number of sodas drunk. 11 sodas bought - 3 sodas drunk = 8 sodas left.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of extras by subtracting the number of sodas drunk from the number of sodas left. 8 sodas left - 3 sodas drunk = 5 sodas extra.\n\nThe answer is 5 sodas extra.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1632.png"}
