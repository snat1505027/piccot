{"question": "An experienced ice skater spins on the ice, creating a perfect circle. Afterwards, she calculates that it must have a circumference of 6.28 yards. What is the circle's diameter?", "qid": "1364", "response": "To find the diameter of the circle, we need to use the formula C = \u03c0d, where C is the circumference, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven that the circumference is 6.28 yards, we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\n6.28 = \u03c0d\n\nNow, we need to solve for d. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nd = 6.28 / \u03c0\n\n2. Simplify the fraction:\n\nd = 2\n\nThe answer is 2 yards.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1364.png"}
