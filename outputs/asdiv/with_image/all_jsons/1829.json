{"question": "Your local radio station is having their yearly music player and concert ticket giveaway. For one minute, every 5th caller will win a music player and every 7th caller will win concert tickets. You were just the first caller to win both a music player and concert tickets! What number caller were you?", "qid": "1829", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of callers who won both a music player and concert tickets. We can start by finding the number of callers who won a music player and then find the number of callers who won concert tickets. We can then find the intersection of these two sets of callers.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of callers who won a music player. We know that every 5th caller will win a music player. So, we can find the number of callers by dividing the total number of callers by 5.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of callers who won concert tickets. We know that every 7th caller will win concert tickets. So, we can find the number of callers by dividing the total number of callers by 7.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of these two sets of callers. We can do this by finding the common multiple of 5 and 7, which is 35. This means that every 35th caller will win both a music player and concert tickets.\n\nTo find the number of callers who won both a music player and concert tickets, we can divide the total number of callers by 35.\n\nThe answer is 285.", "answer": 35, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1829.png"}
