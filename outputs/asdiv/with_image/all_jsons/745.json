First, we need to find the number of buses needed to transport the students.\n\n86 students / 9 students per bus = 9.55 buses (rounded up to the nearest whole number)\n\n2. Next, we need to find the number of students left after all the buses have been filled.\n\n86 students - (9.55 buses x 9 students per bus) = 86 students - 86.55 students = 0.55 students left\n\nThe answer is 0.55 students left.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/745.png"}
