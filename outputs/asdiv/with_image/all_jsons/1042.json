{"question": "Kevin started his science test at 2:34 p.m. and finished the test 75 minutes later. Kevin has football practice at 4:15 p.m. How much time did Kevin have between the end of the test and the beginning of football practice?", "qid": "1042", "response": "First, we need to find the time when Kevin finished the test. We know that he finished the test 75 minutes after he started it. We can use the information provided in the image to find the time when he finished the test.\n\n2:34 + 75 minutes = 3:19\n\nNext, we need to find the time when football practice starts. We know that football practice starts at 4:15 p.m.\n\nNow, we need to find the time between the end of the test and the beginning of football practice.\n\n3:19 - 4:15 = -0:56\n\nSince the time is negative, it means that the test ended before the practice started. The answer is 0:56.", "answer": 26, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1042.png"}
