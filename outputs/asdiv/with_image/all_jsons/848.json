{"question": "Jake bought a book of tickets for the rides at Fun Land. 8 of the tickets were red. There were twice as many blue tickets as red tickets. Jake used all 6 of his yellow tickets first. How many tickets did Jake buy in all?", "qid": "848", "response": "First, we need to find the number of blue tickets. Since there are twice as many blue tickets as red tickets, we can find the number of blue tickets by multiplying the number of red tickets by 2.\n\n8 red tickets x 2 = 16 blue tickets\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of tickets Jake bought. We can do this by adding the number of red tickets and the number of blue tickets.\n\n8 red tickets + 16 blue tickets = 24 tickets\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the number of yellow tickets Jake used from the total number of tickets he bought.\n\n24 tickets - 6 yellow tickets = 18 tickets left to use\n\nThe answer is 18 tickets.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/848.png"}
