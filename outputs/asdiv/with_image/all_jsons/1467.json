{"question": "Billy was painting a wall in his room. The total area was 8 square feet. If the wall was 2 feet wide, how tall is it?", "qid": "1467", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the wall. We know that the total area of the wall is 8 square feet and the width is 2 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the height:\n\nArea = width x height\n\nSince the total area is 8 square feet, we can set up the equation:\n\n8 = 2 x height\n\nNow, we need to solve for the height. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n4 = height\n\nSince the height must be a whole number, we can round up or down to find the answer. Let's round down:\n\nThe answer is 4 feet.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1467.png"}
