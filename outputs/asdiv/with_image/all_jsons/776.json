{"question": "A ballet class wants to divide its 90 members into some large groups at 7 members each and some small groups at 3 members each. In order to make the least number of groups, how many large groups should be made?", "qid": "776", "response": "To make the least number of groups, we need to minimize the number of small groups. We can do this by maximizing the number of members in each large group.\n\nLet's start by dividing the total number of members by the desired number of members in each large group:\n90 members / 7 members per large group = 12.857142857 (rounded to the nearest integer)\n\nSince we want to make the least number of groups, we should round up to the nearest integer, which gives us 13 large groups.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of members in each small group. We can do this by subtracting the total number of members from the total number of large group members:\n90 members - 13 large groups \\* 7 members per large group = 120 members\n\nSince we have 13 large groups, we need to divide the remaining 120 members into small groups. We can do this by dividing the remaining members by the desired number of members in each small group:\n120 members / 3 members per small group = 40 small groups\n\nThe answer is 13 large groups and 40 small groups.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/776.png"}
