{"question": "The perimeter of a postcard is 20 inches. The postcard is 6 inches wide. How tall is it?", "qid": "1374", "response": "To find the height of the postcard, we need to use the perimeter formula: P = 2W + 2H, where P is the perimeter, W is the width, and H is the height.\n\nWe know that the perimeter is 20 inches, and the width is 6 inches. We can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n20 = 2W + 2H\n\nNow, we need to solve for H. To do this, we can subtract 2W from both sides of the equation:\n\n20 - 2W = 2H\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 2 to isolate H:\n\n10 - W = H\n\nSince we know the width is 6 inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n10 - 6 = H\n\nNow, we can solve for H:\n\n4 = H\n\nThe height of the postcard is 4 inches.\n\nThe answer is 4 inches.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1374.png"}
