{"question": "Two clocks are turned on at the same time. One clock chimes every 15 minutes. The other clock chimes every 25 minutes. In how many minutes will they chime together?", "qid": "1866", "response": "To find the time when the two clocks will chime together, we need to find the common multiple of 15 and 25.\n\nFirst, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 25 by multiplying both numbers together:\n\n15 x 25 = 375\n\nNow, we can find the smallest multiple of 375 that is a multiple of both 15 and 25. The smallest multiple of 375 that is a multiple of both 15 and 25 is 375 x 15 x 25 = 3,187,500.\n\nThe clocks will chime together in 3,187,500 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 3,187,500 minutes.", "answer": 75, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1866.png"}
