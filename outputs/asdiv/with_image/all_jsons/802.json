{"question": "Magellan has decided to make party baskets for the fund raiser. Balloons are sold in bags of 20, party horns are sold in bags of 10, and there are 8 candy bars in a package. How many of each should he buy so there are an equal number of balloons, horns and candy bars in each basket?", "qid": "802", "response": "To find the number of balloons, party horns, and candy bars in each basket, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 10, and 8. The LCM of 20, 10, and 8 is 80.\n\nTo make the baskets equal, we need to divide the total number of items (80) by the number of baskets. Let's assume we have 10 baskets.\n\n80 / 10 = 8\n\nSo, there should be 8 balloons, 8 party horns, and 8 candy bars in each basket.\n\nThe answer is 8 balloons, 8 party horns, and 8 candy bars in each basket.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/802.png"}
