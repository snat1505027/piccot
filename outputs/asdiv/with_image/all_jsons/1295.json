{"question": "A railway half ticket costs half the full fare and the reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket. One reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216 and one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?", "qid": "1295", "response": "Let's start by analyzing the information provided in the image. The image shows a table with various prices for different types of tickets. We can see that one full first class ticket costs $327, and one half first class ticket costs $163.50. We also know that the reservation charge is the same for both full and half tickets.\n\nTo find the basic first class full fare, we need to find the cost of one full first class ticket without the reservation charge. We can do this by subtracting the reservation charge from the total cost of the ticket. In this case, the reservation charge is $163.50, so the basic first class full fare would be $327 - $163.50 = $163.50.\n\nTo find the reservation charge, we can use the information that the reservation charge is the same for both full and half tickets. Since the half ticket costs half the full fare, we can find the reservation charge by dividing the cost of the half ticket by 2. In this case, the reservation charge would be $163.50 / 2 = $81.75.\n\nThe answer is:\nThe basic first class full fare is $163.50, and the reservation charge is $81.75.", "answer": 210, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1295.png"}
