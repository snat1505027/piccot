{"question": "The zookeeper has 68 fish to feed to the penguins. 19 penguins have already gotten a fish. The zoo has 36 penguins. How many more penguins need to get a fish?", "qid": "856", "response": "To find out how many more penguins need to get a fish, we need to subtract the number of penguins that have already gotten a fish from the total number of penguins.\n\n68 fish - 19 fish = <<68-19=49>>49 fish left\n\n49 fish / 36 penguins = <<49/36=1.39>>1.39 fish per penguin\n\nSince we cannot feed a fraction of a fish to a penguin, we need to round up the number of fish per penguin to the nearest whole number.\n\n1.39 fish per penguin rounded up to the nearest whole number = <<1.4=1>>1 fish per penguin\n\nTherefore, the zookeeper needs to feed 36 penguins - 19 penguins = <<36-19=17>>17 more penguins.\n\nThe answer is 17.", "answer": 17, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/856.png"}
