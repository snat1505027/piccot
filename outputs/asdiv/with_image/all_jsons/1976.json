{"question": "Vanessa uploaded twenty-three pictures from her phone and seven from her camera to Facebook. If she sorted the pics into five different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?", "qid": "1976", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pictures in each album. First, we need to find the total number of pictures Vanessa uploaded. The image shows that she uploaded twenty-three pictures from her phone and seven from her camera, so the total number of pictures is twenty-three + seven = thirty.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. The image shows that there are five albums, so we need to divide thirty by five. Thirty divided by five is six.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that each album has six pictures.\n\nThe answer is six.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1976.png"}
