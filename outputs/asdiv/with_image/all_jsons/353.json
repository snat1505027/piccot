{"question": "Andrew's 4 friends decided to bring food as well. If each of them brought 4 slices of pizza, how many slices of pizza do they have in total?", "qid": "353", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of slices of pizza that Andrew's 4 friends brought. We can do this by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices each friend brought.\n\n4 friends x 4 slices each friend = 16 slices of pizza\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of slices of pizza that Andrew brought. We know that Andrew brought 4 slices of pizza, so we can add that to the total number of slices brought by his friends.\n\n16 slices of pizza (friends) + 4 slices of pizza (Andrew) = 20 slices of pizza\n\nThe answer is 20 slices of pizza.", "answer": 16, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/353.png"}
