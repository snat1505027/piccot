The original price of the rare robot is $3.00. Michael offered to sell it for three times the original price.\n\nFirst, we need to find the price of the rare robot when multiplied by three. We can do this by multiplying the original price by three:\n\n$3.00 \\* 3 = $9.00\n\nNow, we know that Tom needs to pay $9.00 for the rare robot.\n\nThe answer is $9.00.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/378.png"}
