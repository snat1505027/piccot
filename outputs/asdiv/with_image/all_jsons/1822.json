{"question": "Camryn practices the trumpet every 11th day and the flute every 3rd day. Camryn practiced both the trumpet and the flute today. How many days until Camryn practices the trumpet and flute again in the same day?", "qid": "1822", "response": "To find the number of days until Camryn practices the trumpet and flute again in the same day, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 3.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of 11 and 3:\n11 = 11 (prime)\n3 = 3 (prime)\n\nNext, we find the prime factors of the LCM of 11 and 3:\nLCM(11, 3) = 33\n\n33 = 3^2 \\* 11\n\nNow, we can find the number of days until Camryn practices the trumpet and flute again in the same day by dividing 33 by the smallest prime factor, which is 3:\n\n33 \u00f7 3 = 11\n\nSo, Camryn will practice the trumpet and flute again in the same day after 11 days.\n\nThe answer is 11 days.", "answer": 33, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1822.png"}
