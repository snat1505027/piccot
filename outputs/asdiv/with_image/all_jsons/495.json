{"question": "Shiela was into history of Asia. She can read 11 pages per hour of the book entitled \"Asia's History Made Easy\". If the encyclopedia has 143 pages, how many hours did it take Shiela to finish reading the book?", "qid": "495", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hours it took Sheila to finish reading the book. We know that she can read 11 pages per hour, and the book has 143 pages.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many hours it would take her to read the entire book. We can do this by dividing the number of pages in the book by the number of pages she can read per hour:\n\n143 pages / 11 pages per hour = 13 hours\n\nHowever, we are given that Sheila finished reading the book, so we need to find out how many hours it actually took her. We can do this by subtracting the number of hours it would take her to read the entire book from the total time it took her to finish reading the book:\n\n13 hours - 13 hours = 0 hours\n\nThe answer is 0 hours.", "answer": 13, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/495.png"}
