{"question": "I think of a number. If I subtract 6 from the number and divide it by 13, I will get the result as 2. Find the number in my mind.", "qid": "1195", "response": "Let's start by solving the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. We know that if we subtract 6 from the number and divide it by 13, we will get the result as 2.\n2. So, let's first solve the division problem: 13 \u00f7 2 = 6.5.\n3. Now, we need to find the original number. We know that the original number minus 6 is equal to 6.5.\n4. Let's call the original number \"x\". So, x - 6 = 6.5.\n5. Now, we can solve for \"x\": x = 6.5 + 6 = 12.5.\n6. Since we are looking for an integer, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13.\n\nThe answer is 13.", "answer": 32, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1195.png"}
