{"question": "Points A and B are 70 km apart on a highway. A car starts from A and another car starts from B at the same time. If they travel in the same direction, they meet in 7 hours, but if they travel towards each other they meet in one hour. What are their respective speeds?", "qid": "1291", "response": "Let's analyze the image and find the answer.\n\nThere are three sections in the image, each with a different scenario.\n\n1. The first section shows that the cars meet in 7 hours when traveling in the same direction.\n2. The second section shows that the cars meet in 1 hour when traveling towards each other.\n3. The third section shows the distance between A and B, which is 70 km.\n\nWe can use the information from the second section to find the speed of the cars when traveling towards each other. Since they meet in 1 hour, we can calculate the distance traveled by dividing the distance between A and B by the time it takes to meet.\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 70 km / 1 hour\n\nDistance = 70 km / 1\n\nDistance = 70\n\nNow, we can use the information from the first section to find the speed of the cars when traveling in the same direction. Since they meet in 7 hours, we can calculate the distance traveled by dividing the distance between A and B by the time it takes to meet.\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nDistance = 70 km / 7 hours\n\nDistance = 70 km / 7\n\nDistance = 10 km/hour\n\nNow we have the speed of the cars when traveling in the same direction and the speed when traveling towards each other.\n\nThe answer is:\n\nWhen traveling in the same direction, the cars have a speed of 10 km/hour.\nWhen traveling towards each other, the cars have a speed of 70 km/hour.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1291.png"}
