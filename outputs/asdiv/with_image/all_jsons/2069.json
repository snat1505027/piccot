We know that there are 25 pencils in total and they are organized into 5 groups. We can use the following formula to find the size of each group:\n\nSize of each group = Total number of pencils / Number of groups\n\nIn this case, the formula would be:\n\nSize of each group = 25 / 5\n\nNow, let's calculate the result:\n\nSize of each group = 25 / 5 = 5\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2069.png"}
