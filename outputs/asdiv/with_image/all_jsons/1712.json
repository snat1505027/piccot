{"question": "Carol had ninety-seven pieces of tissue paper. After blowing her nose she had ninety-three left. How many pieces of tissue paper did she use?", "qid": "1712", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of tissue paper Carol used. We know that she had 97 pieces initially and 93 pieces left after blowing her nose. We can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\n97 - x = 93\n\nNow we need to solve for x, which represents the number of pieces of tissue paper Carol used. To do this, we can add 93 to both sides of the equation:\n\n97 + 93 = x\n\n190 = x\n\nNow we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the average number of pieces of tissue paper Carol used per blow:\n\n190 \u00f7 2 = x\n\n95 = x\n\nSo, Carol used 95 pieces of tissue paper.\n\nThe answer is 95.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1712.png"}
