{"question": "The Math Counts Club had a party at school. There were 20 cookies and 40 slices of pizza to be shared equally. Each student had the same number of whole cookies and the same number of slices of pizza with nothing left over. What is the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get?", "qid": "1868", "response": "To find the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices each student can get, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 40. The GCD of 20 and 40 is 20.\n\nSince the number of cookies and pizza slices must be divisible by 20, we can divide both 20 and 40 by 20:\n\n20 / 20 = 1\n40 / 20 = 2\n\nTherefore, each student can get 1 cookie and 2 slices of pizza.\n\nThe answer is 1 cookie and 2 slices of pizza.", "answer": 20, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1868.png"}
