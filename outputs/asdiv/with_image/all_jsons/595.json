{"question": "John can read 4 books a day. He reads every Monday and Tuesday. How many books would he read in 6 weeks?", "qid": "595", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books John reads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.\n\nJohn reads 4 books a day, and he reads on Monday and Tuesday. So, he reads 4 books on Monday and 4 books on Tuesday. In total, he reads 8 books in a week.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many weeks John reads for 6 weeks. Since he reads 8 books a week, we can divide 6 by 8 to find out the number of weeks.\n\n6 weeks \u00f7 8 books per week = 0.75 weeks\n\nSince John reads 8 books a week, and there are 7.5 weeks, he would read 8 books \u00d7 7.5 weeks = 60 books in 6 weeks.\n\nThe answer is 60 books.", "answer": 48, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/595.png"}
