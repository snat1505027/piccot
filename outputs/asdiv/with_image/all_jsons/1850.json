{"question": "Mitch owns a business and assigns two of his employees their shifts. He assigns the first employee shifts in blocks of 2 hours, and he assigns the second worker shifts in blocks of 11 hours. If both workers must receive the same number of hours, what is the minimum number of hours each must be assigned?", "qid": "1850", "response": "To find the minimum number of hours each worker must be assigned, we need to find the total number of hours for both employees and divide it by the total number of employees.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of hours for the first employee. The first employee is assigned shifts in blocks of 2 hours. We can find the total number of hours by multiplying the number of shifts by the number of hours per shift:\n\n2 hours/shift \\* 11 shifts = 22 hours\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of hours for the second employee. The second employee is assigned shifts in blocks of 11 hours. We can find the total number of hours by multiplying the number of shifts by the number of hours per shift:\n\n11 hours/shift \\* 1 shift = 11 hours\n\nNow, we can find the total number of hours for both employees by adding the total hours for the first employee and the total hours for the second employee:\n\n22 hours + 11 hours = 33 hours\n\nFinally, we can find the minimum number of hours each worker must be assigned by dividing the total number of hours by the total number of employees:\n\n33 hours \u00f7 2 employees = 16.5 hours\n\nThe answer is 16.5 hours.", "answer": 22, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1850.png"}
