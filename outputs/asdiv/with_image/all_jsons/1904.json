The price of each kitten is $6.\n3. The store also sold 1 puppy, and its price is $5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money earned:\n\n2 kittens x $6 each = $<<2*6=12>>12\n1 puppy x $5 = $<<1*5=5>>5\n\nTotal earnings = $12 + $5 = $<<12+5=17>>17\n\nThe answer is $17.", "answer": 17, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1904.png"}
