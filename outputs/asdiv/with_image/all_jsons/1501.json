We know that the ratio of up votes to down votes is 9:2, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nUp votes: 18\nDown votes: 2 \\* x\n\nSince the ratio is 9:2, we can divide the number of up votes by 2 to find the number of down votes:\n\nDown votes = 18 / 2 = 9\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1501.png"}
