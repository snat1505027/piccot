{"question": "P and Q start at the same time in the same direction to run around a stadium. P completes a round in 252 seconds and Q in 198 seconds, both starting at the same point. After what time will they meet again at the starting point?", "qid": "1855", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the time difference between P and Q. We can do this by subtracting the time taken by Q from the time taken by P.\n\nP takes 252 seconds to complete a round, and Q takes 198 seconds to complete a round.\n\n252 - 198 = 54 seconds\n\nNow, we need to convert the time difference into minutes and hours.\n\n54 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 0.9333 minutes\n\n0.9333 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.1555 hours\n\nSince the time difference is less than an hour, we can round it to the nearest hour.\n\n0.1555 hours = 1 hour and 15 minutes\n\nThe answer is 1 hour and 15 minutes.", "answer": 2772, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1855.png"}
