{"question": "A company invited sixty-eight people to a luncheon, but fifty of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held three people each, how many tables do they need?", "qid": "2028", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tables needed for the remaining people.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of people who didn't show up. In the image, it says \"People who didn't show up: 50.\"\n2. Next, we need to find the number of people who did show up. In the image, it says \"People who showed up: 68.\"\n3. Now, we need to find the number of tables needed for the people who showed up. We can do this by dividing the number of people by the number of people per table. In the image, it says \"People per table: 3.\"\n\n68 people / 3 people per table = 22.67 tables\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a table, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of tables. In this case, we need 23 tables.\n\nThe answer is 23 tables.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2028.png"}
