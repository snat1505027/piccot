{"question": "Peter has 54 tickets and 4 pencils. If he shares the tickets among 9 friends, how many tickets does each friend get?", "qid": "2082", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many tickets Peter has in total and then divide that number by the number of friends he is sharing the tickets with.\n\nPeter has 54 tickets and 4 pencils. We can represent this as 54 + 4 = 58.\n\nNow, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends. In this case, there are 9 friends. So, we divide 58 by 9:\n\n58 \u00f7 9 = 6.4444...\n\nSince we cannot share a fraction of a ticket, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round 6.4444 to 6.\n\nTherefore, each friend gets 6 tickets.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2082.png"}
