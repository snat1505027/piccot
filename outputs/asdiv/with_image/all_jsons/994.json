{"question": "While counting chairs in the lunch room, Marie noticed that there were 14 chairs in the first row, 23 chairs in the second row, 32 chairs in the third row, 41 chairs in the fourth row, and 50 chairs in the fifth row. If this pattern continues, how many chairs will there be in the sixth row?", "qid": "994", "response": "To find the number of chairs in the sixth row, we need to find the pattern in the given numbers. The pattern is that each row has one more chair than the previous row.\n\n14 + 1 = 15\n15 + 1 = 16\n16 + 1 = 17\n17 + 1 = 18\n18 + 1 = 19\n19 + 1 = 20\n\nSo, the pattern is that each row has one more chair than the previous row. To find the number of chairs in the sixth row, we need to add one more chair to the number of chairs in the fifth row, which is 50.\n\n50 + 1 = 51\n\nThe answer is 51.", "answer": 50, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/994.png"}
