{"question": "Sarah's Shipping and Ryan's Mail Services both ship packages. Sarah's trucks will only carry loads of 18 packages. In contrast, Ryan's trucks will only carry loads of 11 packages. If both businesses ended up shipping the same number of packages this morning, what is the minimum number of packages each must have shipped? ", "qid": "1811", "response": "To find the minimum number of packages each must have shipped, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 11. The LCM of 18 and 11 is 198.\n\nSince both businesses ended up shipping the same number of packages, we can say that Sarah's trucks shipped 198 packages, and Ryan's trucks shipped the same number of packages.\n\nThe answer is 198.", "answer": 198, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1811.png"}
