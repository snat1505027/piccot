We can do this by subtracting the number of bales in the barn and the shed from the total number of bales in the barn.\n\nThere were forty-seven bales of hay in the barn and forty bales in the shed, making a total of eighty-seven bales.\n\nBenny stacked more bales in the barn today, so the total number of bales in the barn is now eighty-two.\n\nTo find out how many bales Benny stacked, we can subtract the number of bales in the barn and the shed from the total number of bales in the barn:\n\n80 (bales in the barn) + 47 (bales in the shed) = 127\n\n127 - 82 = 45\n\nThe answer is 45.", "answer": 35, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1240.png"}
