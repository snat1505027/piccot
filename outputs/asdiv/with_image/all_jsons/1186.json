{"question": "The present ages of Lewis and Brown are in the ratio 1:2. Three years from now, the ages will be in the ratio 3:5. Find the present ages of Lewis and Brown.", "qid": "1186", "response": "Let's start by using the information provided in the image. The present ages of Lewis and Brown are in the ratio 1:2. We can represent this as 1x : 2x, where x is the common factor.\n\nThree years from now, their ages will be in the ratio 3:5. We can represent this as 3x : 5x.\n\nSince the ratio of their ages will change from 1:2 to 3:5, we can deduce that the common factor x will change from 1 to 3.\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion equation to find the present ages of Lewis and Brown.\n\n1x : 2x = 3x : 5x\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n1x \\* 5x = 2x \\* 3x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5x^2 = 6x\n\nx^2 - 6x = 0\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nSince the common factor x will change from 1 to 3, the present age of Lewis will change from 1x to 3x, and the present age of Brown will change from 2x to 5x.\n\nThe present ages of Lewis and Brown are 2 and 5 years, respectively.\n\nThe answer is 2 and 5.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1186.png"}
