{"question": "The ski resort reported 65 inches of snow in January. They measured 18 inches of snow during the first week. They measured 25 inches of snow the second week. How much snow did they get the rest of the month?", "qid": "928", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of snowfall in January. We know that the ski resort got 65 inches of snow in January, and we know that they got 18 inches of snow during the first week and 25 inches of snow during the second week. We can use this information to find the total snowfall for the rest of the month.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total snowfall for the first two weeks. We can do this by adding the snowfall for the first week and the second week: 18 + 25 = 43 inches.\n\nNext, we need to find the total snowfall for the rest of the month. We can do this by subtracting the total snowfall for the first two weeks from the total snowfall for the entire month: 65 - 43 = 22 inches.\n\nThe answer is 22 inches.", "answer": 22, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/928.png"}
