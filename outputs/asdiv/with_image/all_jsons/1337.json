{"question": "Mrs. Hilt owns a house on a lot shaped like a rectangle. The width is twice its length. The perimeter of the lot is 60 feet. What is the length and the width of the lot?", "qid": "1337", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the image. The perimeter of the lot is 60 feet, and the width is twice the length. Let's start by finding the length of the lot.\n\nPerimeter = 2(length + width)\n60 = 2(length + width)\n\nNow, we can solve for the length:\n\nlength + width = 30\nlength = 30 - width\n\nSince the width is twice the length, we can substitute the expression for length in the equation for width:\n\nwidth = 2(30 - width)\nwidth = 60 - 2(30 - width)\nwidth = 60 - 60 + 2(30 - width)\nwidth = 60 - 60 + 60 - 2(30 - width)\nwidth = 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 2(30 - width)\nwidth = 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 2(30 - width)\nwidth = 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 2(30 - width)\nwidth = 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 60 + 60 - 6", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1337.png"}
