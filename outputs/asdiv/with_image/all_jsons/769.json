{"question": "Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many small trucks should be used?", "qid": "769", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of small trucks needed to load the total amount of fruits.\n\n134 tons of fruits to be loaded.\n\n1 large truck can load 15 tons of fruits.\n\n1 small truck can load 7 tons of fruits.\n\nWe can calculate the number of large trucks needed by dividing the total amount of fruits by the capacity of a large truck:\n\n134 tons / 15 tons per large truck = 9 large trucks needed.\n\nSince we have 9 large trucks, we can now calculate the number of small trucks needed by dividing the total amount of fruits by the capacity of a small truck:\n\n134 tons / 7 tons per small truck = 19 small trucks needed.\n\nThe answer is 19 small trucks.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/769.png"}
