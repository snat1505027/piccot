{"question": "There are 22 dogs in the farm. They live in 5 dog-houses equally. How many dogs are there in each dog-house?", "qid": "752", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of dogs in each dog-house. First, we need to find the total number of dogs in the farm, which is 22. Next, we need to find the number of dog-houses, which is 5. To find the number of dogs in each dog-house, we can divide the total number of dogs by the number of dog-houses.\n\n22 dogs \u00f7 5 dog-houses = 4.4 dogs per dog-house\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a dog, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n4.4 dogs \u00f7 1 = 4 dogs per dog-house\n\nThe answer is 4 dogs per dog-house.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/752.png"}
