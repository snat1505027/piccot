{"question": "Dean knew that they are going to stay at the beach for a while, so he brought 30 sets of clothes for every week of their stay. If Dean is staying for 4 weeks there, how many sets of clothes did he bring?", "qid": "406", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sets of clothes Dean brought. We know that Dean brought 30 sets of clothes per week and is staying for 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of sets of clothes for one week. We can do this by dividing 30 by the number of weeks Dean is staying:\n\n30 sets of clothes per week \u00f7 4 weeks = 7.5 sets of clothes per week\n\nSince Dean brought 30 sets of clothes per week, we can find the number of sets of clothes for one week by multiplying 30 by 1/7:\n\n30 sets of clothes per week \u00d7 1/7 = 4.2857 sets of clothes per week\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a set of clothes, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 5 sets of clothes per week.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of sets of clothes Dean brought by multiplying the number of sets of clothes per week by the number of weeks he is staying:\n\n5 sets of clothes per week \u00d7 4 weeks = 20 sets of clothes\n\nThe answer is 20 sets of clothes.", "answer": 120, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/406.png"}
