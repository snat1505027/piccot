{"question": "Philip is buying pens and pencils from the store. Pens come in packages of 12, but pencils are sold in packages of 15. If Philip wishes to purchase the same number of pens as pencils, what is the smallest number of pens that he can buy?", "qid": "911", "response": "To find the smallest number of pens that Philip can buy, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of 12 and 15. We can start by finding the smallest common multiple of 12 and 15, which is 60. Since 60 is divisible by both 12 and 15, it is the smallest number of pens that Philip can buy to match the number of pencils.\n\nThe answer is 60.", "answer": 60, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/911.png"}
