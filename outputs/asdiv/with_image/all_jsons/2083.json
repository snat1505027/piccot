{"question": "Ronald has 16 eggs and 3 candies. If he shares the eggs among 8 friends, how many eggs does each friend get?", "qid": "2083", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of eggs Ronald has. We can do this by adding the number of eggs and candies together: 16 + 3 = 19.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of friends Ronald is sharing the eggs with. In this case, there are 8 friends.\n\nNow, we can find the number of eggs each friend gets by dividing the total number of eggs by the total number of friends: 19 \u00f7 8 = 2.375.\n\nSince eggs come in whole numbers, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means each friend gets 2 eggs.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/2083.png"}
