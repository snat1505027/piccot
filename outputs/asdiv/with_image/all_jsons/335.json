{"question": "Kevin and his family just moved to a new neighborhood so they are holding a party to be able to meet their new neighbors. For the party, they prepared a few snacks for everyone. If his sister prepared 25 mini cupcakes and his mother prepared 30, how many did his grandmother prepare if they have a total of 100 cupcakes?", "qid": "335", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cupcakes Kevin's grandmother prepared. We know that his sister prepared 25 cupcakes and his mother prepared 30 cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes prepared by the family is 25 + 30 = 55.\n\nWe also know that the total number of cupcakes at the party is 100. To find the number of cupcakes Kevin's grandmother prepared, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes prepared by his sister and his mother from the total number of cupcakes. 100 - 25 - 30 = 45.\n\nThe answer is 45.", "answer": 45, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/335.png"}
