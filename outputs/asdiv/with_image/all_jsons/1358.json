{"question": "A length of wire is cut into several smaller pieces. Each of the smaller pieces are bent into squares. Each square has a side that measures 2 centimeters. The total area of the smaller squares is 92 square centimeters. What was the original length of wire?", "qid": "1358", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the wire that was cut into smaller pieces. We can start by using the information that each square has a side length of 2 centimeters. We can then use the fact that the total area of the smaller squares is 92 square centimeters to find the number of squares.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of a single square. We can do this by multiplying the side length by itself: 2 cm x 2 cm = 4 cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, we can find the total number of squares by dividing the total area by the area of a single square: 92 cm\u00b2 \u00f7 4 cm\u00b2 = 23 smaller squares.\n\nSince we know that each square has a side length of 2 centimeters, we can find the length of the wire by multiplying the number of squares by the side length of each square: 23 squares x 2 cm/square = 4.6 cm.\n\nThe answer is 4.6 cm.", "answer": 184, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1358.png"}
