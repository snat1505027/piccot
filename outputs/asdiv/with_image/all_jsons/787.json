{"question": "There are 315 cups of puddings to be distributed to 218 students. If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?", "qid": "787", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many extra pudding cups are needed to distribute them equally among the 218 students.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of pudding cups per student. To do this, we divide the total number of pudding cups (315) by the number of students (218):\n\n315 cups \u00f7 218 students = 1.45 cups per student\n\nSince the number of cups per student is not an integer, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 2 cups per student.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many students will receive 2 cups of pudding. To do this, we multiply the number of students (218) by the number of cups per student (2):\n\n218 students \u00d7 2 cups per student = 436 cups\n\nSince we have already distributed 315 cups, we need to find the difference between the total number of cups needed (436) and the number of cups already distributed (315):\n\n436 cups - 315 cups = 121 cups\n\nTherefore, we need 121 extra cups of pudding to distribute them equally among the 218 students.\n\nThe answer is 121.", "answer": 121, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/787.png"}
