{"question": "Our watermelons have 100 seeds each. If we have 4 watermelons, how many seeds should there be when all seeds are taken out of the watermelons?", "qid": "554", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of seeds in the watermelons. We know that each watermelon has 100 seeds, and we have 4 watermelons.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of seeds in one watermelon. We can do this by multiplying the number of seeds per watermelon by the number of watermelons:\n\n100 seeds per watermelon \\* 4 watermelons = 400 seeds\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of seeds in all the watermelons. We can do this by multiplying the number of seeds in one watermelon by the total number of watermelons:\n\n400 seeds per watermelon \\* 4 watermelons = 1600 seeds\n\nThe answer is 1600 seeds.", "answer": 400, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/554.png"}
