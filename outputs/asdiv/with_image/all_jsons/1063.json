{"question": "While sorting some beads, Jenna put 74 beads in the first jar, 83 beads in the second jar, 92 beads in the third jar, and 101 beads in the fourth jar. If this pattern continues, how many beads will Jenna put in the fifth jar?", "qid": "1063", "response": "To find the number of beads in the fifth jar, we need to find the pattern in which the number of beads increases. The pattern is that the number of beads increases by 10 in each jar.\n\n1. 74 + 10 = 84 beads in the second jar.\n2. 83 + 10 = 93 beads in the third jar.\n3. 92 + 10 = 102 beads in the fourth jar.\n\nTo find the number of beads in the fifth jar, we add 10 to the number of beads in the fourth jar:\n\n102 + 10 = 112 beads in the fifth jar.\n\nThe answer is 112.", "answer": 110, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1063.png"}
