{"question": "Ned was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry eight trays at a time. If he had to pick up twenty-seven trays from one table and five trays from another, how many trips will he make?", "qid": "1987", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of trays Ned will carry and the number of trips he will make.\n\n1. Total number of trays: 27 (from the first table) + 5 (from the second table) = 32 trays.\n2. Number of trips: Since Ned can carry eight trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by eight. 32 trays \u00f7 8 = 4 trips.\n\nThe answer is 4 trips.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1987.png"}
