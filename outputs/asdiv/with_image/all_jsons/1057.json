{"question": "Ava bagged the plastic bottles after a recycling drive. She placed 45 bottles in the first bag, 53 bottles in the second bag, 61 bottles in the third bag, and 69 bottles in the fourth bag. If this pattern continues, how many plastic bottles will Ava put in the fifth bag?", "qid": "1057", "response": "To find the number of plastic bottles in the fifth bag, we need to find the pattern in the given numbers. The difference between the number of bottles in the second and third bags is 8 (53 - 61 = 8). The difference between the number of bottles in the third and fourth bags is 8 as well (61 - 69 = 8).\n\nWe can use this pattern to find the number of bottles in the fifth bag. The difference between the number of bottles in the fourth and fifth bags is 8, so we can add 8 to the number of bottles in the fourth bag to find the number of bottles in the fifth bag:\n\n69 + 8 = 77\n\nThe answer is 77.", "answer": 77, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/1057.png"}
