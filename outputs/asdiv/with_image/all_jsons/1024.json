{"question": "Students at Memorial School voted for their favorite snack. For every 5 students that voted for candy, 2 students voted for popcorn. There were a total of 45 votes for candy. How many fewer students voted for popcorn than candy?", "qid": "1024", "response": "To find the number of students who voted for popcorn, we can use the information that for every 5 students who voted for candy, 2 students voted for popcorn. We can set up a proportion to represent this relationship:\n\ncandy votes : popcorn votes = 5 : 2\n\nSince we know that there were a total of 45 votes for candy, we can use this information to find the number of students who voted for popcorn:\n\n45 votes for candy : x votes for popcorn = 5 : 2\n\nx = (45/5) \\* 2\nx = 9\n\nTherefore, there were 9 fewer students who voted for popcorn than candy. The answer is 9.", "answer": 27, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1024.png"}
