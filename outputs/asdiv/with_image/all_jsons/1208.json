{"question": "The length of the rectangular building is 7 ft more than its width. If the perimeter of the building wall is 98 ft, find its length and width.", "qid": "1208", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the image. The perimeter of the building wall is 98 ft, and the length of the building is 7 ft more than its width. Let's start by finding the width of the building.\n\n1. The perimeter of the building wall is 98 ft.\n2. The length of the building is 7 ft more than its width.\n\nWe can use the perimeter formula to find the width:\n\nPerimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\n98 = 2(Length + Width)\n\nNow, we can solve for the width:\n\nWidth = 98 / 2 - Length\n\nSince the length is 7 ft more than the width, we can substitute the length with 7 ft more than the width:\n\nWidth = 98 / 2 - (Length + 7)\n\nWe can simplify the equation:\n\nWidth = 49.5 - Length - 7\n\nNow, we can substitute the width back into the perimeter formula to find the length:\n\nLength + Width = 98\n\nLength + (49.5 - Length - 7) = 98\n\nWe can simplify the equation:\n\n2Length + 49.5 - 7 = 98\n\n2Length + 49.5 - 7 = 98\n\n2Length = 98 - 49.5 + 7\n\n2Length = 48.5 + 7\n\n2Length = 55.5\n\nNow, we can find the length:\n\nLength = 55.5 / 2\n\nLength = 27.75\n\nThe width of the building is 49.5 - 7 = 42.5.\n\nThe answer is: The length of the building is 27.75 ft, and the width is 42.5 ft.", "answer": 28, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1208.png"}
