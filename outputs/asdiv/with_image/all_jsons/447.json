{"question": "Christian's father and the senior ranger gathered firewood as they walked towards the lake in the park and brought with them sacks. If every sack can contain around 20 pieces of wood, how many sacks were they able to fill if they gathered 80 pieces of wood?", "qid": "447", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sacks filled with 80 pieces of wood. We can use the information provided in the image to help us.\n\nIn the image, there is a table with the following information:\n\n1. Number of sacks filled: 80\n2. Number of pieces of wood gathered: 80\n3. Number of sacks filled per 20 pieces of wood: 4\n\nWe can use the third piece of information to find the number of sacks filled. Since they gathered 80 pieces of wood and each sack can hold 20 pieces, we can divide 80 by 20 to find the number of sacks filled:\n\n80 pieces of wood \u00f7 20 pieces per sack = 4 sacks filled\n\nThe answer is 4 sacks filled.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/447.png"}
