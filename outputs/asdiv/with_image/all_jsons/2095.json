{"question": "There are 43 students and 1720 apples. Each student has 9 Skittles. If the apples are divided equally among the students, how many does each student get?", "qid": "2095", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples each student gets if they are divided equally among the students.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of apples that can be divided among the students. We can do this by multiplying the number of students by the number of apples per student.\n\n43 students x 1720 apples per student = 72,600 apples\n\nSince there are 72,600 apples and 43 students, we can divide the apples equally among the students. To do this, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of students.\n\n72,600 apples \u00f7 43 students = 1678 apples per student\n\nSince we have 1678 apples per student, we can now find out how many Skittles each student gets. We know that each student gets 9 Skittles. To find out how many Skittles each student gets in total, we can multiply the number of apples per student by the number of Skittles per student.\n\n1678 apples per student x 9 Skittles per student = 15,162 Skittles per student\n\nSince we have 15,162 Skittles per student, we can now find out how many Skittles each student gets in total. We can do this by dividing the total number of Skittles by the number of students.\n\n15,162 Skittles per student \u00f7 43 students = 352 Skittles per student\n\nThe answer is 352 Skittles per student.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/2095.png"}
