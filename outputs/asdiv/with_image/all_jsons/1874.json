{"question": "Samantha has two pieces of cloth. One piece is 72 inches wide and the other piece is 90 inches wide. She wants to cut both pieces into strips of equal width that are as wide as possible. How wide should she cut the strips?", "qid": "1874", "response": "To find the width of the strips, we need to find the average width of the two pieces of cloth.\n\nFirst, we add the widths of the two pieces of cloth: 72 + 90 = 162 inches.\n\nThen, we divide the total width by the number of pieces: 162 / 2 = 81 inches.\n\nSince the width of the strips should be as wide as possible, we can round up the width to the nearest whole number.\n\nThe answer is 81 inches.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1874.png"}
