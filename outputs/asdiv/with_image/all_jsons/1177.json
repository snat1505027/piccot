{"question": "Devon is 12 years old. His age is 2 more than half the age of Steven. Find the age of Steven.", "qid": "1177", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Steven. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\n1. Devon is 12 years old.\n2. Devon's age is 2 more than half the age of Steven.\n\nWe can represent this information in the form of an equation:\n\nDevon's age = Steven's age + 2\n\nWe can substitute the value of Devon's age with the equation:\n\nSteven's age = (Devon's age - 2) / 2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of Steven's age back into the original equation:\n\nDevon's age = Steven's age + 2\nSteven's age = (Devon's age - 2) / 2\n\nWe can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n2 \\* Devon's age = 2 \\* Steven's age + 4\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of Devon's age with the equation:\n\n2 \\* (Devon's age - 2) = 2 \\* Steven's age + 4\n\nWe can simplify the equation by adding 2 to both sides:\n\n2 \\* Devon's age - 4 = 2 \\* Steven's age + 4\n\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nDevon's age - 2 = Steven's age + 2\n\nWe can substitute the value of Devon's age with the equation:\n\nSteven's age = (Devon's age - 2) / 2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of Steven's age back into the original equation:\n\nDevon's age - 2 = Steven's age + 2\n\nWe can simplify the equation by adding 2 to both sides:\n\nDevon's age = Steven's age + 4\n\nWe can substitute the value of Devon's age with the equation:\n\nSteven's age = (Devon's age - 4) / 2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of Steven's age back into the original equation:\n\nDevon's age = Steven", "answer": 20, "correct": false, "image": "images/asdiv/1177.png"}
