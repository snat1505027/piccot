{"question": "There are sixty-four pigs in the barn. Some more come to join them. Now there are eighty-six pigs. How many pigs came to join them?", "qid": "133", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of pigs in the barn after they joined and the number of pigs before they joined.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of pigs that came to join them. We can do this by subtracting the initial number of pigs (64) from the final number of pigs (86).\n\n64 - 86 = -22\n\nSince the number of pigs cannot be negative, we need to add 22 to the initial number of pigs to find the correct answer.\n\n64 + 22 = 86\n\nTherefore, the answer is 22 pigs came to join them.", "answer": 22, "correct": true, "image": "images/asdiv/133.png"}
