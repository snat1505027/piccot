Twice the son's age + the father's age = 70\n2. Twice the father's age + the son's age = 95\n\nNow, let's solve these equations simultaneously. We can start by isolating the son's age in the first equation:\n\n2x(son's age) = 70 - father's age\n\nThen, we can substitute this expression for the son's age in the second equation:\n\n2(70 - father's age) + father's age = 95\n\nNow, we have a single equation with two variables:\n\n2(70 - father's age) + father's age = 95\n\nTo solve this equation, we can first add 70 to both sides to eliminate the 2:\n\n2(70 - father's age) + father's age = 95 + 70\n\n2(70 - father's age) + father's age = 165\n\nNext, we can simplify by adding 70 to both sides again:\n\n2(70 - father's age) + father's age = 165 + 70\n\n2(70 - father's age) + father's age = 235\n\nNow, we can simplify by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n(70 - father's age) + father's age = 117.5\n\n(70 - father's age) + father's age = 117.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of an age, we can conclude that the father and son must have the same age.

Let's start by using the information provided in the question:\n\n1. A man is thrice as old as his son.\n2. After 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son.\n\nWe can use the first statement to find the ratio of their ages. Let's call the son's age x. Then, the man's age would be 3x.\n\nNow, we can use the second statement to find the difference in their ages after 12 years. Let's call the man's age after 12 years y. Since he will be twice as old as his son, the difference in their ages will be 2y - x.\n\nWe can now set up an equation to solve for x and y:\n\n3x = y + 12\n2y - x = 12\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the present ages of the man and his son.\n\nFirst, we can solve the second equation for x:\n\nx = 2y - 12\n\nThen, we can substitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n\n3(2y - 12) = y + 12\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n6y - 36 = y + 12\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n5y = 48\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\ny = 9.6\n\nNow that we have y, we can find x:\n\nx = 2y - 12\n\nx = 2(9.6) - 12\n\nx = 19.2 - 12\n\nx = 7.2\n\nSo, the son's age is 7.2 years, and the man's age is 3 times that, or 21.6 years.\n\nThe answer is: The man is 21.6 years older than his son, and the son is 7.2 years old.", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "7.2", "is_correct_last": 0}

To find out how many extra coats there will be, we can subtract the total number of coats per box from the total number of coats:\n\n29 coats - (3 boxes \u00d7 10 coats per box) = 29 coats - 30 coats = -1 coat\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a negative number of coats, we need to add 1 coat to the result to get a positive number:\n\n-1 coat + 1 coat = 0 coats\n\nTherefore, there will be 0 extra coats left over.

Downhill speed = 50 km/h\n\nTotal distance = 650 km\n\nTotal time = (Uphill distance + Downhill distance) / (Uphill speed + Downhill speed)\n\nSince the car went uphill and downhill, we can write:\n\nUphill time = (650 km - Downhill distance) / 30 km/h\n\nDownhill time = (650 km - Uphill distance) / 50 km/h\n\nWe know that the total time is 15 hours, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n(Uphill time + Downhill time) = 15 hours\n\nNow, we can solve for the Uphill distance and Downhill distance:\n\nUphill distance = 650 km - Downhill distance\n\nDownhill distance = 650 km - Uphill distance\n\nWe can substitute these expressions into the equations for Uphill time and Downhill time:\n\nUphill time = (650 km - Downhill distance) / 30 km/h\n\nDownhill time = (650 km - Uphill distance) / 50 km/h\n\nNow, we can solve for the Uphill distance and Downhill distance:\n\nUphill distance = 650 km - Downhill distance\n\nDownhill distance = 650 km - Uphill distance\n\nWe can substitute these expressions into the original equations:\n\n1.

If we divide the 27 star stickers by the number of stickers per page, we get:\n\n27 star stickers / 10 stickers per page = 2.7 pages\n\nAgain, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of pages. Therefore, Tess can decorate 3 pages with star stickers.\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate with both heart and star stickers without any stickers left over. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of heart stickers and the number of star stickers. The GCD of 45 and 27 is 1.\n\nSince the GCD is 1, Tess can place one heart sticker and one star sticker on each page. If we assume that each page has 10 stickers, we can calculate the number of pages Tess can decorate with both heart and star stickers:\n\n1 heart sticker + 1 star sticker / 10 stickers per page = 1 page\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate is 1 page.\n\nThe answer is 1 page.", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "2.7", "is_correct_last": 0}

So, the total number of pins Sam knocked down is 8x.\n\nNow, we know that Sam and Carlos have the same total number of pins at the end of the day.

So, the total number of pins Carlos knocked down is 9x.\n\nSince Sam and Carlos have the same total number of pins, we can substitute 8x for Carlos' total number of pins in the equation:\n\n8x = 9x\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x':\n\n8x = 9x\n7x = 0\nx = 0\n\nThis is an impossible solution, as the number of bowls cannot be zero.

We know that the second angle is five times as large as the first, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nSecond angle = 5 x First angle\n\nWe also know that the third angle is 12 degrees greater than the first angle. So, we can set up another equation:\n\nThird angle = First angle + 12\n\nNow, we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for the first angle by using the second equation and substituting it into the first equation:\n\nFirst angle = (Third angle - 12) / 5\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for the first angle into the second equation:\n\nSecond angle = 5 x (Third angle - 12) / 5\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nSecond angle = 3 x Third angle - 60\n\nFinally, we can substitute this expression for the second angle into the third equation:\n\nThird angle = First angle + 12\n\nThird angle = 12 + 3 x Third angle - 60\n\nThird angle = 3 x Third angle - 72\n\nNow, we have a system of equations with two unknowns:\n\n1.

We can use the equation:\n\nSailor's speed in still water = (Upstream speed + Downstream speed) / 2\n\nNext, we need to find the upstream speed and downstream speed. The upstream speed is the speed the sailor goes when moving upstream, and the downstream speed is the speed the sailor goes when moving downstream.\n\nUpstream speed = Sailor's speed in still water + Current speed\nDownstream speed = Sailor's speed in still water - Current speed\n\nWe know that the sailor goes 8 km downstream in 40 minutes, so the upstream speed is:\n\nUpstream speed = 8 km / 40 minutes = 0.2 km/min\n\nWe also know that the sailor comes back in 1 hour, so the downstream speed is:\n\nDownstream speed = 0.2 km/min - Current speed\n\nNow we can solve for the current speed:\n\nDownstream speed = 0.2 km/min - Current speed\nCurrent speed = Downstream speed + Upstream speed\nCurrent speed = 0.2 km/min + 0.2 km/min\nCurrent speed = 0.4 km/min\n\nFinally, we can find the sailor's speed in still water:\n\nSailor's speed in still water = (Upstream speed + Downstream speed) / 2\nSailor's speed in still water = (0.2 km/min + 0.4 km/min) / 2\nSailor's speed in still water = 0.3 km/min\n\nThe answer is 0.3 km/min.", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "0.3", "is_correct_last": 0}

We know that the circle is inside a square piece of paper with an area of 400 square inches. Since the circle touches each side of the square, we can use the fact that the area of a circle is equal to the square of its radius.\n\nLet's start by finding the radius of the circle. We can do this by dividing the square's diagonal length by 2. The diagonal length of a square is the length of a line segment that connects two opposite corners of the square.\n\nThe diagonal length of the square is equal to the square root of the area of the square.

Since the total number of marbles is 480, and each heap contains 9 marbles, we can find the number of heaps by dividing the total number of marbles by the number of marbles per heap:\n\n480 marbles \u00f7 9 marbles per heap = 53 heaps of 9 marbles\n\nNow, we can add the number of heaps of 6 marbles and the number of heaps of 9 marbles to find the total number of heaps:\n\n80 heaps of 6 marbles + 53 heaps of 9 marbles = 133 heaps\n\nFinally, we can find the number of marbles each boy has by dividing the total number of marbles by the total number of heaps:\n\n480 marbles \u00f7 133 heaps = 3.63 marbles per heap\n\nSince the number of marbles per heap is not a whole number, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This gives us the final answer:\n\nEach boy has 4 marbles.\n\nThe answer is 4 marbles.", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "3.63", "is_correct_last": 0}

We can do this by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's call the third angle y. Since two angles are the same size, we can write:\n\nx + x = 180 - y\n\nAdding x to both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n2x = 180 - y\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 90 - y/2\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the equation we found earlier:\n\nx + x = 180 - y\n\n90 - y/2 + 90 - y/2 = 180 - y\n\n180 - y = 180 - y\n\ny = 0\n\nNow that we know y = 0, we can substitute this value back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = 90 - y/2\n\nx = 90 - 0/2\n\nx = 90\n\nSo the first angle is 90 degrees.

We are given that 26 people are in the tourist group, and they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each.\n\nWe can start by setting up two equations:\n\n1. L + 2S = 26 (total number of people)\n2. 3L + 2S = 26 (total number of people)\n\nNow, we can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can solve equation 1 for L:\n\nL = 26 - 2S\n\nNext, we can substitute this expression for L into equation 2:\n\n3(26 - 2S) + 2S = 26\n\nNow, we can solve for S:\n\n78 - 6S + 2S = 26\n\n5S = 78\n\nS = 15.6\n\nSince we cannot rent a fraction of a room, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we should rent 16 small rooms.\n\nNow, we can use the expression we found for L to calculate the number of large rooms:\n\nL = 26 - 2S\nL = 26 - 2 \\* 16\nL = 26 - 32\nL = -6\n\nThis is not a valid solution, as the number of large rooms cannot be negative.

The equation is:\n\ntime = (distance \u00f7 speed) + scheduled time\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find the length of the journey. The train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster, it would have taken 8 hours less than the scheduled time.

The perimeter is given as 51 yards.\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the perimeter of an equilateral triangle:\n\nPerimeter = (side length) \\* 3\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of the perimeter into the formula:\n\n51 yards = (side length) \\* 3\n\nTo solve for the side length, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\nside length = 51 yards / 3\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression:\n\nside length = 17 yards\n\nSo, the measure of each side of the wall is 17 yards.\n\nThe answer is 17 yards.", "is_correct": 1, "predict_last": "-10000000000", "is_correct_last": 0}

The sandbox is 312 centimeters long and 146 centimeters wide.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the centimeters to meters. 1 centimeter is equal to 0.01 meters. So, the sandbox is 312 cm long and 146 cm wide, which is equal to 3.12 meters long and 1.46 meters wide.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the sandbox. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. In this case, the area of the sandbox is 3.12 meters long x 1.46 meters wide = 4.512 square meters.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the area from square meters to square centimeters. 1 square meter is equal to 100000 square centimeters. So, the area of the sandbox in square centimeters is 4.512 square meters x 100000 square centimeters/square meter = 4512000 square centimeters.\n\nThe answer is 4512000 square centimeters.", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "4.512", "is_correct_last": 0}
