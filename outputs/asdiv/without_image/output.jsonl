We can write this as x/y = 5/7.\n\nNext, we can use the fact that the difference between x and y is 12. We can write this as x - y = 12.\n\nNow, we can solve the equation x/y = 5/7 for x. To do this, we can multiply both sides by y to get x = (5/7)y.\n\nFinally, we can substitute the expression for x into the equation x - y = 12 to get (5/7)y - y = 12.

Let B represent Blair's age and L represent London's age. We know that several years ago, Blair was twice as old as London, so we can write:\n\nB = 2L\n\nWe also know that Blair is currently 16 years old, so we can substitute the value of B in the equation:\n\n16 = 2L\n\nNow, we need to solve for L.

We know that the angles are in the ratio 1:2:3, which means that the first angle is one-third of the sum of the other two angles. Let's call the first angle x, the second angle y, and the third angle z.\n\nWe can start by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, we can write:\n\nx + y + z = 180\n\nNext, we can use the ratio 1:2:3 to find the relationship between the angles. Since the first angle is one-third of the sum of the other two angles, we can write:\n\nx = (1/3) \\* (y + z)\n\nNow we have two equations with three unknowns. To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of elimination. We can add the two equations together to eliminate one of the variables:\n\n(1/3) \\* (y + z) + (1/2) \\* (y + z) = 180\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2 \\* (y + z) = 360\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\ny + z = 180\n\nNow we have a single equation with two unknowns. We can use the method of substitution to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for y:\n\ny = 180 - z\n\nSubstituting this expression for y in the original equation, we get:\n\nx = (1/3) \\* (180 - z + z)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = (1/3) \\* 180\n\nx = 60\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can use the expression we derived earlier for y:\n\ny = 180 - z\n\nSubstituting x for z in this equation, we get:\n\ny = 180 - 60\n\ny = 120\n\nFinally, we can use the expression we derived earlier for z:\n\nz = 1", "predict": "-10000000000", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "1.0", "is_correct_last": 0}

P = B + 5\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously by using the first equation to substitute for B in the second equation:\n\nP/3 = B\nP = 3B\nP = B + 5\n3B = B + 5\n\nNow we can simplify the equation:\n\n3B = B + 5\n3B - B = 5\n2B = 5\nB = 5/2\n\nNow we can substitute B back into the first equation to find P:\n\nP/3 = 5/2\nP = 5/2 \\* 3\nP = 5\n\nNow we have the ages of the cousins:\n\nPete: P/3 = 5/3 = 2\nBryan: B = 5/2 = 2.5\nPhilip: P = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5\n\nThe answer is:\nPete: 2\nBryan: 2.5\nPhilip: 7.5", "predict": "2.0", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "7.5", "is_correct_last": 0}

So, 24 square miles is equal to:\n\n24 square miles \\* 640 acres/square mile = 15,552,000 square feet\n\nNext, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the woods. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the hypotenuse is the width of the woods (8 miles), and the other two sides are the length of the woods and the width of the woods. We can represent this as:\n\n(Length of woods)^2 + (Width of woods)^2 = (8 miles)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the length of the woods.

We can rearrange the first equation to solve for the breadth:\n\n(length x breadth) - 9 = (length - 5) x (breadth + 3)\n\nBreadth = (length x breadth) - 9 - (length - 5) x (breadth + 3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for breadth in the second equation:\n\n(length + 3) x (breadth + 2) = (length x breadth) + 67\n\n(length + 3) x (length x breadth) - 9 - (length - 5) x (length x breadth) + 67 = 67\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(length + 3) x (length x breadth) - 9 - (length - 5) x (length x breadth) + 67 = 67\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n(length + 3) x (length x breadth) - 9 - (length x breadth) + 67 = 67\n\nMultiplying the terms, we get:\n\n(length + 3) x (length x breadth) - 9 - (length x breadth) + 67 = 67\n\n(", "predict": "-10000000000", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "67.0", "is_correct_last": 0}

We can do this by using the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nFor the upstream journey, the boat travels 30 km in 10 hours, so the speed is:\n\n30 km / 10 hours = 3 km/hour\n\nFor the downstream journey, the boat travels 44 km in 10 hours, so the speed is:\n\n44 km / 10 hours = 4.4 km/hour\n\nNow, we need to find the speed of the stream. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nSpeed of the stream = (Speed of the boat in still water) x (1 + (Distance upstream / Distance downstream))\n\nFor the upstream journey, the boat travels 40 km in 13 hours, so the speed of the stream is:\n\n40 km / 13 hours = 3.07 km/hour\n\nFor the downstream journey, the boat travels 55 km in 13 hours, so the speed of the stream is:\n\n55 km / 13 hours = 4.23 km/hour\n\nThe answer is:\n\nThe speed of the boat in still water is 3 km/hour, and the speed of the stream is 3.07 km/hour for the upstream journey and 4.23 km/hour for the downstream journey.", "predict": "3.0", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "4.23", "is_correct_last": 0}

Let's assume that Janice has x pieces of ribbon, and Jasmine has y pieces of ribbon.\n\nFor Janice, we know that x = 2m, and for Jasmine, we know that y = 5m.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of equal lengths of ribbon that they have combined. This can be found by adding the number of equal lengths of ribbon that Janice and Jasmine have:\n\nx + y = 2m + 5m\n\nNext, we need to find the number of equal lengths of ribbon that they have after cutting. This can be found by dividing the total number of equal lengths of ribbon by the length of each piece:\n\n(x + y) / (2m + 5m) = (x + y) / (2m) + (x + y) / (5m)\n\nSince there is no remainder in both cases, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n(x + y) / (2m) = (x + y) / (5m)\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y:\n\nx + y = 2m(x + y) / (2m)\nx + y = 5m(x + y) / (5m)\n\nx + y = 2m(x + y) / 2m\nx + y = 5m(x + y) / 5m\n\nx + y = 2m(x + y) / 2m\nx + y = 5m(x + y) / 5m\n\nx + y = 2m(x + y) / 2m\nx + y = 5m(x + y) / 5m\n\nx + y = 2m(x + y) / 2m\nx + y = 5m(x + y) / 5m\n\nx + y = 2m(x + y) / 2", "predict": "-10000000000", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "2.0", "is_correct_last": 0}

The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width.\n\nLet's start by finding the length of the rectangle. We know that the distance around the garden is 36 feet, and we are given that one side measures 10 feet. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the rectangle.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the hypotenuse is the side of the rectangle that is 36 feet long, and the other two sides are the 10-foot side and the perpendicular side.\n\nLet's call the length of the 10-foot side x. Then, the perpendicular side would be 36 - 10 = 26 feet.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\nx^2 + 26^2 = 36^2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx^2 = 36^2 - 26^2\nx^2 = 1176 - 676\nx^2 = 490\nx = 23\n\nNow that we have the length of the rectangle, we can find its width. Since the width is perpendicular to the length, we can simply take the length and multiply it by the square root of 2.\n\nWidth = x \\* sqrt(2)\nWidth = 23 \\* sqrt(2)\nWidth = 32.414 feet\n\nFinally, we can calculate the area of the garden by multiplying the length and width.\n\nArea = length \\* width\nArea = 23 \\* 32.414\nArea = 750.892 square feet\n\nThe answer is 750.892 square feet.", "predict": "750.892", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "750.892", "is_correct_last": 0}

To do this, we can subtract the cost of the sofa from the total cost:\n\nLove seat = 444 - Sofa\nLove seat = 444 - 2 x Love seat\n\nNow, we can solve for the cost of the love seat:\n\nLove seat = 444 - 2 x Love seat\n2 x Love seat = 444 - Love seat\nLove seat = (444 - Love seat) / 2\nLove seat = 222 - (444 - Love seat) / 2\nLove seat = 222 - 222 + Love seat / 2\nLove seat = Love seat / 2\n\nThe cost of the love seat is half of its original cost.

The sum total of the ages of the father and the son is 55 years. If the father was to live until his son's age equals his present age, the total of their ages would be 93 years.\n\nLet's assume that the father's age is x and the son's age is y. We can start by setting up an equation based on the information provided:\n\nx + y = 55 (the sum total of their ages)\n\nWe also know that if the father lives until his son's age equals his present age, the total of their ages would be 93 years. So, we can set up another equation:\n\nx + y = 93 (the total of their ages when the father lives until his son's age equals his present age)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (x and y). We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination.\n\nLet's use the first equation to solve for y:\n\ny = 55 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the second equation:\n\nx + (55 - x) = 93\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2x = 93 - 55\n\nx = 38\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:\n\ny = 55 - x\n\ny = 55 - 38\n\ny = 17\n\nThe father's age is 38 years, and the son's age is 17 years.\n\nThe answer is: The father's age is 38 years, and the son's age is 17 years.", "predict": "38.0", "is_correct": 0, "predict_last": "17.0", "is_correct_last": 0}
