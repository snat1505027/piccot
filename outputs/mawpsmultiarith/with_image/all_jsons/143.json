{"question": "Edward had 43 books. If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 14 new books, how many books would Edward have?", "qid": "143", "response": "First, we need to find out how much money Edward earned from selling the 19 books. We can do this by multiplying the number of books sold by the price of each book.\n\n19 books sold x $19/book = $<<19*19=38>>38\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Edward spent on buying the 14 new books. We can do this by multiplying the number of new books by the price of each book.\n\n14 new books x $14/book = $<<14*14=196>>196\n\nNow, we can find out how much money Edward has left after buying the new books by subtracting the amount spent from the amount earned.\n\n$38 - $196 = -$<<38-196=-158>>158\n\nSince Edward has a negative amount of money, it means he has spent more than he earned. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nThe answer is -158.", "answer": 38, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/143.png"}
