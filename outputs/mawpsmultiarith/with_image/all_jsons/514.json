{"question": "A pet store had 81 puppies. In one day they sold 41 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage. How many cages did they use?", "qid": "514", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cages used to hold the remaining puppies. First, we need to find the number of puppies left after selling 41 of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of puppies sold from the initial number of puppies.\n\n81 puppies - 41 puppies = 40 puppies\n\nNext, we need to find the number of puppies that can fit into each cage. We can do this by dividing the number of puppies left by the number of puppies per cage.\n\n40 puppies \u00f7 8 puppies per cage = 5 cages\n\nSo, the pet store used 5 cages to hold the remaining puppies.\n\nThe answer is 5 cages.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/514.png"}
