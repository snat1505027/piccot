{"question": "There are 58 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 10 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 8 groups, how many students would be in each group?", "qid": "569", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students in the 8 groups and then divide it by the number of groups.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of students who didn't get picked for the team. There are 10 students who didn't get picked, so we can add this number to the total number of students trying out.\n\n58 students trying out + 10 students who didn't get picked = 68 students in total.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of students in the 8 groups. To do this, we can multiply the total number of students by the number of groups.\n\n68 students in total \u00f7 8 groups = 8.5 students per group.\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to round the number down to the nearest whole number.\n\n8.5 students per group \u00f7 1 = 8 students per group.\n\nThe answer is 8 students per group.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/569.png"}
