{"question": "Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?", "qid": "510", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of points scored by everyone else on the team. We know that Paige scored 11 points, and the total number of points is 41. We can set up the equation:\n\nPaige's points + everyone else's points = Total points\n\n11 + x = 41\n\nNow, we need to find the number of players on the team. Since everyone else scored 6 points each, we can find the number of players by dividing the total points by the points scored by each player:\n\nTotal points / Points scored by each player = Number of players\n\n41 / 6 = 7\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/510.png"}
