{"question": "The cafeteria had 96 apples. For lunch they handed out 42 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 6 apples, how many pies could they make?", "qid": "521", "response": "To find the number of pies that can be made, we need to find the number of apples left after handing out 42 apples for lunch. We can do this by subtracting the number of apples handed out from the total number of apples.\n\n96 apples - 42 apples = 54 apples\n\nNow, we need to find the number of pies that can be made using these 54 apples. Each pie takes 6 apples, so we can find the number of pies by dividing the number of apples by the number of apples per pie.\n\n54 apples \u00f7 6 apples per pie = 9 pies\n\nThe answer is 9 pies.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/521.png"}
