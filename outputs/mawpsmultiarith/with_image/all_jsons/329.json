{"question": "Dave was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make?", "qid": "329", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many trips Dave will make to pick up the trays from both tables.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many trips Dave will make to pick up the trays from the first table. Since he can carry 9 trays at a time, we can divide the number of trays he needs to pick up by 9.\n\n17 trays \u00f7 9 trays per trip = 1.8889 trips\n\nSince Dave can only make whole trips, he will make 2 trips to pick up the trays from the first table.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many trips Dave will make to pick up the trays from the second table. Since he can carry 9 trays at a time, we can divide the number of trays he needs to pick up by 9.\n\n55 trays \u00f7 9 trays per trip = 6.1111 trips\n\nSince Dave can only make whole trips, he will make 7 trips to pick up the trays from the second table.\n\nIn total, Dave will make 2 trips to the first table and 7 trips to the second table, making a total of 9 trips.\n\nThe answer is 9 trips.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/329.png"}
