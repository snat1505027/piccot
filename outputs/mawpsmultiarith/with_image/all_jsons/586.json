{"question": "A pet store had 56 puppies. In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use?", "qid": "586", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cages were used to hold the remaining puppies. First, we need to find out how many puppies were left after selling 24 of them. We can do this by subtracting 24 from 56.\n\n56 puppies - 24 puppies = 32 puppies\n\nNext, we need to find out how many puppies can fit in a cage. We know that there are 4 puppies in each cage.\n\nTo find out how many cages were used, we need to divide the number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage.\n\n32 puppies \u00f7 4 puppies per cage = 8 cages\n\nThe answer is 8 cages.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/586.png"}
