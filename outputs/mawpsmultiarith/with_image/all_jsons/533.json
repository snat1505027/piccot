{"question": "A company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 5 people each, how many tables do they need?", "qid": "533", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tables needed for the remaining 40 people.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of people per table. We can do this by dividing the total number of people by the number of tables.\n\n40 people / 5 people per table = 8 tables\n\n2. Next, we need to find the number of tables needed for the 40 people. We can do this by multiplying the number of people by the number of tables per person.\n\n40 people x 5 tables per person = 200 tables\n\n3. Since the company only has 8 tables, we need to find the number of tables they need to accommodate the remaining 200 people.\n\n200 people - 40 people = 160 people\n\n160 people / 5 people per table = 32 tables\n\n4. The company needs 32 tables to accommodate the remaining 160 people.\n\nThe answer is 32 tables.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/533.png"}
