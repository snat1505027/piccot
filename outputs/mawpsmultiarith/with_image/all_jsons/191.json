{"question": "A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?", "qid": "191", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of oranges that were left in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and the new ones were added.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of oranges that were thrown away. We can do this by subtracting the number of new oranges from the initial number of oranges in the bin.\n\n40 oranges - 21 new oranges = 19 oranges thrown away\n\nNext, we need to add the number of new oranges to the number of oranges that were thrown away.\n\n19 oranges thrown away + 21 new oranges = 39 oranges in the bin\n\nThe answer is 39.", "answer": 36, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/191.png"}
