{"question": "Isabel picked 66 flowers for her friend\u2019s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?", "qid": "517", "response": "First, we need to find the number of bouquets Isabel can make using the flowers she picked. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of bouquets = Number of flowers / Number of flowers per bouquet\n\nIn this case, the number of flowers is 66, and the number of flowers per bouquet is 8. So, we can calculate the number of bouquets as follows:\n\nNumber of bouquets = 66 / 8\nNumber of bouquets = 8.25\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bouquet, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up to 9 bouquets.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of bouquets from the total number of flowers to find the number of flowers that wilted. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nNumber of flowers wilted = Total number of flowers - Number of bouquets\n\nIn this case, the total number of flowers is 66, and the number of bouquets is 9. So, we can calculate the number of flowers wilted as follows:\n\nNumber of flowers wilted = 66 - 9\nNumber of flowers wilted = 57\n\nFinally, we can find the number of bouquets Isabel can still make by subtracting the number of flowers wilted from the total number of flowers. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nNumber of bouquets still possible = Total number of flowers - Number of flowers wilted\n\nIn this case, the number of bouquets still possible is:\n\nNumber of bouquets still possible = 66 - 57\nNumber of bouquets still possible = 9\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/517.png"}
