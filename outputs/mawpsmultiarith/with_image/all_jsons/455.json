Number of lives each player had before quitting: 8\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of lives the players had before quitting. We can do this by multiplying the number of players by the number of lives each player had:\n\n10 players \\* 8 lives/player = 80 lives\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of lives the remaining players have. We can do this by subtracting the number of lives the players who quit had from the total number of lives:\n\n80 lives - 7 \\* 8 = 72 lives\n\nThe answer is 72 lives.", "answer": 24, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/455.png"}
