{"question": "Ned was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 5 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 5 trays from one table and 5 trays from another, how many trips will he make?", "qid": "372", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of trays that Ned will carry. The image shows that Ned can carry 5 trays at a time. To find the total number of trays, we need to multiply the number of trays from the first table by the number of trays from the second table.\n\nThe first table has 5 trays, and the second table has 5 trays. So, the total number of trays is 5 x 5 = 25.\n\nSince Ned can carry 5 trays at a time, he will make 25 / 5 = 5 trips to pick up all the trays.\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/372.png"}
