{"question": "Oliver made 35 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 7 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 4 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?", "qid": "551", "response": "First, we need to find out how much money Oliver has left after buying the new mower blades. We know that he made 35 dollars and spent 7 dollars, so he has 35 - 7 = <<35-7=28>>28 dollars left.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 4 dollar games he can buy with the money he has left. We can do this by dividing the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game. 28 / 4 = <<28/4=7>>7.\n\nSo, Oliver can buy 7 4 dollar games with the money he has left.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/551.png"}
