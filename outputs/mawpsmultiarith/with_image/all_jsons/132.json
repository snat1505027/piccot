{"question": "At the arcade Jerry won 4 tickets. If he spent 2 tickets on a beanie and later won 47 more tickets, how many would he have?", "qid": "132", "response": "First, we need to find the number of tickets Jerry had after spending 2 tickets on a beanie. We can do this by subtracting the number of tickets spent from the number of tickets he won:\n\n4 tickets - 2 tickets = 2 tickets\n\nNext, we need to find the number of tickets Jerry won later. The image shows that he won 47 more tickets. We can add this number to the number of tickets he had after spending 2 tickets on a beanie:\n\n2 tickets + 47 tickets = 49 tickets\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of tickets Jerry had after winning 49 tickets. We can do this by adding the number of tickets he had after spending 2 tickets on a beanie to the number of tickets he won later:\n\n49 tickets - 2 tickets = 47 tickets\n\nThe answer is 47 tickets.", "answer": 49, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/132.png"}
