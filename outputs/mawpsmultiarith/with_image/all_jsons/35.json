{"question": "Haley and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Haley picked 39 and her mother picked 38. If only 64 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?", "qid": "35", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of carrots that Haley and her mother picked. We can do this by adding the number of carrots Haley picked (39) and the number of carrots her mother picked (38).\n\n39 + 38 = 77\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of good carrots. We know that 64 of the carrots were good, so we can subtract the number of bad carrots from the total number of carrots.\n\n77 - 64 = 13\n\nThe answer is 13.", "answer": 13, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/35.png"}
