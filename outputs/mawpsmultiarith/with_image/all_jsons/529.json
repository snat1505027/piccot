{"question": "Mike is at the library helping put away books. There are 82 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Mike with the rest. If he can fit 9 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?", "qid": "529", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of shelves needed to accommodate the remaining books. First, we need to find the number of books Mike will have after the librarian takes 10 books. We can do this by subtracting 10 from the total number of books:\n\n82 books - 10 books = <<82-10=72>>72 books\n\nNext, we need to find the number of shelves needed to hold the 72 books. We can do this by dividing the total number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n\n72 books \u00f7 9 books per shelf = <<72/9=8>>8 shelves\n\nThe answer is 8 shelves.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/529.png"}
