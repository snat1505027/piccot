{"question": "Debby bought two coloring books. One had 16 pictures and the other had 40. After one week she had already colored 33 of the pictures. How many pictures does she still have to color?", "qid": "62", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of pictures in both coloring books. We can do this by adding the number of pictures in each book: 16 + 40 = 56.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of pictures Debby has colored. We know that she has colored 33 pictures, so we can add this number to the total number of pictures: 56 + 33 = 89.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of pictures Debby still has to color by subtracting the total number of pictures she has colored from the total number of pictures in both coloring books: 89 - 89 = 0.\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 23, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/62.png"}
