{"question": "Edward earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 6 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 2 of them, how much money did he actually earn?", "qid": "494", "response": "First, we need to find the number of lawns mowed. Since he forgot to mow 2 lawns, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of lawns.\n\n6 lawns - 2 lawns = 4 lawns\n\nNext, we need to find the number of lawns mowed by multiplying the number of lawns by the amount of money earned per lawn.\n\n4 lawns x $9 = $<<4*9=36>>36\n\nFinally, we need to find the actual amount of money earned by subtracting the number of lawns forgotten from the total amount earned.\n\n$36 - $2 = $<<36-2=34>>34\n\nThe answer is $34.", "answer": 36, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/494.png"}
