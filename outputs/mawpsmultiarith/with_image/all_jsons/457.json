{"question": "A painter needed to paint 11 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?", "qid": "457", "response": "The painter has already painted 2 rooms, which means he has painted a total of 2 + 11 = 13 rooms.\nEach room takes 7 hours to paint, so the total time to paint all 13 rooms is 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 hours.\nSince the painter has already painted 2 rooms, he has painted a total of 2 rooms out of the 13 rooms, which means he has 13 - 2 = <<13-2=11>>11 rooms left to paint.\nThe answer is 91 hours.", "answer": 63, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/457.png"}
