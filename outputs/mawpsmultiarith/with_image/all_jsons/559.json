{"question": "Nancy had 101 homework problems. She finished 47 of them but still had 6 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?", "qid": "559", "response": "Nancy had 101 homework problems in total. She finished 47 of them, leaving her with 6 pages of problems to do. Let's assume that each page has the same number of problems on it.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of problems on the 6 pages. To do this, we can multiply the number of problems Nancy finished (47) by the number of pages she has left (6):\n\n47 problems \\* 6 pages = 282 problems\n\nSince Nancy had 101 problems in total, the number of problems on each page is:\n\n101 problems - 282 problems = -181 problems\n\nThis result is negative, which means there is an error in the problem statement. The correct answer cannot be determined from the given information.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/559.png"}
