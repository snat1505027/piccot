{"question": "There were 2 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total?", "qid": "222", "response": "The image shows a math problem with two equations. The first equation is \"Lives of the first two players = 12,\" and the second equation is \"Lives of the two new players = 12.\" To solve the problem, we need to find the total number of lives for all four players.\n\nFirst, we can find the total number of lives for the first two players by adding their lives together. Since the first equation states that their lives are equal to 12, we can simply multiply 12 by 2 to get the answer: 24.\n\nNext, we can find the total number of lives for the two new players by adding their lives together. Since the second equation states that their lives are equal to 12, we can simply multiply 12 by 2 to get the answer: 24.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of lives for all four players, we can add the total number of lives for the first two players and the two new players together: 24 + 24 = 48.\n\nThe answer is 48.", "answer": 24, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/222.png"}
