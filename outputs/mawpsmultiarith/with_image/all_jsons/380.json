{"question": "Nancy's old washing machine could only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 19 shirts and 8 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?", "qid": "380", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many loads Nancy would have to do to wash 19 shirts and 8 sweaters. Since the washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, we need to divide the total number of items by 9.\n\n19 shirts \u00f7 9 = 2.1111 (rounded down to 2)\n8 sweaters \u00f7 9 = 0.8889 (rounded down to 1)\n\nSince the number of shirts is greater than the number of loads, we will use the number of shirts to determine the number of loads. In this case, Nancy would have to do 2 loads to wash all the shirts.\n\nTo wash all the items, Nancy would need to do 2 loads for the shirts and 1 load for the sweaters. Therefore, the answer is 2 + 1 = 3 loads.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/380.png"}
