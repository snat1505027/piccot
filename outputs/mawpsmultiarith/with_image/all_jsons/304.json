{"question": "Luke made 9 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?", "qid": "304", "response": "First, we need to find the total amount of money Luke made. We can do this by adding the amount he made from mowing lawns and weed eating.\n\n9 + 18 = 27\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount of money Luke spent. We know he spent 3 dollars a week, so we can multiply the number of weeks by 3 to find the total amount of money spent.\n\n3 x 1 = 3\n\nNow we can find the total amount of money Luke has by subtracting the amount he spent from the total amount he made.\n\n27 - 3 = 24\n\nSince Luke has 24 dollars, we can find out how long the money will last him by dividing the amount of money by the amount he spends per week.\n\n24 \u00f7 3 = 8\n\nThe answer is 8 weeks.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/304.png"}
