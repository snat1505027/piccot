{"question": "Bianca earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 17 bags, but didn't recycle 8 of them, how many points would she have earned?", "qid": "451", "response": "First, we need to find the number of bags that were recycled. We know that 17 bags were collected, but 8 of them were not recycled. So, the number of bags recycled is 17 - 8 = 9.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of points earned for the recycled bags. We know that Bianca earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. So, the number of points earned for the 9 recycled bags is 9 \\* 5 = 45.\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the points not earned for the 8 unrecycled bags. The total points earned are 45 - 8 = 37.\n\nThe answer is 37.", "answer": 45, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/451.png"}
