{"question": "Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?", "qid": "334", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of trays Henry will pick up and then divide it by the number of trays he can carry at a time.\n\nFirst, we add the number of trays from the first table (29) and the number of trays from the second table (52): 29 + 52 = 81.\n\nNext, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Henry can carry at a time: 81 \u00f7 9 = 9.\n\nSince Henry can only carry 9 trays at a time, he will need to make 9 trips to pick up all the trays.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/334.png"}
