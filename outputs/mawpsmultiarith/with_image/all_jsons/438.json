{"question": "Will invited 9 friends to a birthday party, but 4 couldn't come. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 8, how many should he buy?", "qid": "438", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cupcakes needed for the 9 friends who could come to the party. We can do this by multiplying the number of friends by the number of cupcakes each person should have.\n\n9 friends x 8 cupcakes per person = 72 cupcakes\n\nSince 4 friends couldn't come, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes for those 4 friends from the total number of cupcakes.\n\n72 cupcakes - 4 x 8 cupcakes = 64 cupcakes\n\nThe answer is 64 cupcakes.", "answer": 40, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/438.png"}
