We know that she baked 36 cupcakes and 9 cookies, and after the sale, she had 4 pastries left to take back home.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many pastries were sold. We can do this by adding the number of cupcakes and cookies that were sold.\n\n36 cupcakes + 9 cookies = 45 pastries sold\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of pastries Paige had left to take back home from the total number of pastries sold.\n\n45 pastries sold - 4 pastries to take back home = 41 pastries sold\n\nThe answer is 41 pastries sold.", "answer": 41, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/31.png"}
