{"question": "Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 and her mother picked 5. If only 12 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?", "qid": "27", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of carrots that Faye and her mother picked. We can do this by adding the number of carrots picked by each person: 23 + 5 = 28.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of good carrots. We know that 12 of the carrots were good, so we can find the total by multiplying the number of good carrots by the total number of carrots: 12 \u00d7 28 = 336.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of bad carrots. We can do this by subtracting the total number of good carrots from the total number of carrots: 28 - 336 = -308. Since there cannot be a negative number of carrots, we know that there were no bad carrots.\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 16, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/27.png"}
