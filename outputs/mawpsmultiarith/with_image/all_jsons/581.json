{"question": "Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?", "qid": "581", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of players on Bianca's team. We know that the total number of points scored by the team is 75, and Bianca scored 45 points. We can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\nTotal points scored by the team = Points scored by Bianca + Points scored by everyone else\n\n75 = 45 + 6(x)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x, which represents the number of players on Bianca's team. To do this, we can first isolate the variable x by subtracting 45 from both sides of the equation:\n\n6(x) = 75 - 45\n\n6(x) = 30\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 30 / 6\n\nx = 5\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/581.png"}
