{"question": "Bianca and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds, how many points did they earn?", "qid": "363", "response": "To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Bianca and her friends separately.\n\n1. For Bianca:\nShe recycled 24 pounds of paper, which is 3 pounds short of a multiple of 3. Therefore, she earned 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 points.\n\n2. For her friends:\nThey recycled 3 pounds of paper, which is a multiple of 3. Therefore, they earned 3 points.\n\nNow, we add the points earned by both Bianca and her friends to find the total points earned: 8 + 3 = <<8+3=11>>11 points.\n\nThe answer is 11 points.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/363.png"}
