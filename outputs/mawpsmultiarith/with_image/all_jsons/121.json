{"question": "At the fair there were 30 people in line for the bumper cars. If 10 of them got tired of waiting and left and 5 more got in line, how many people would be in line?", "qid": "121", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people who got tired of waiting and left, and then add the number of people who got in line after that.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of people who got tired of waiting and left. We know that 10 people got tired of waiting and left, so we can write that as 10 - 5 = 5.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of people who got in line after those 5 people left. We know that 5 more people got in line, so we can write that as 5.\n\nFinally, we need to add the number of people who got tired of waiting and left and the number of people who got in line after that to find the total number of people in line. We can do this by adding 5 and 5, which gives us 10.\n\nThe answer is 10.", "answer": 25, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/121.png"}
