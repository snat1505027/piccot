{"question": "At the town carnival Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. If each ride cost 5 tickets, how many tickets did he use?", "qid": "200", "response": "To find the total number of tickets Billy used, we need to add the number of tickets he used for the ferris wheel and the bumper cars.\n\nFor the ferris wheel, we can use the equation:\n7 rides x 5 tickets per ride = <<7*5=35>>35 tickets\n\nFor the bumper cars, we can use the equation:\n3 rides x 5 tickets per ride = <<3*5=15>>15 tickets\n\nTo find the total number of tickets Billy used, we add the number of tickets for the ferris wheel and the bumper cars:\n35 tickets + 15 tickets = <<35+15=50>>50 tickets\n\nThe answer is 50 tickets.", "answer": 50, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/200.png"}
