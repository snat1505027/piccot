{"question": "Bianca was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 52 seeds and planted 40 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 2 seeds each. How many small gardens did Bianca have?", "qid": "541", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of small gardens. We know that Bianca planted 40 seeds in the big garden and 2 seeds in each of her small gardens. We can represent this information in a table:\n\n| Big Garden | Small Gardens | Total Seeds |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 40 | 2 | 52 |\n\nWe can see that the number of small gardens is equal to the number of seeds planted in the big garden divided by the number of seeds planted in each small garden.\n\n40 seeds in the big garden \u00f7 2 seeds in each small garden = 20 small gardens\n\nThe answer is 20.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/541.png"}
