{"question": "A trivia team had 15 members total, but during a game 6 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 3 points, how many points were scored total?", "qid": "421", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total points scored by the trivia team members who showed up. We can do this by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of members who showed up. We can do this by subtracting the number of members who didn't show up from the total number of members.\n\n15 members total - 6 members who didn't show up = 9 members who showed up\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total points scored by the members who showed up. We can do this by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored.\n\n9 members who showed up x 3 points per member = 27 points scored by the members who showed up\n\nThe answer is 27.", "answer": 27, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/421.png"}
