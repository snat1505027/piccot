{"question": "For homework Faye had 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems. If she can finish 3 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems?", "qid": "361", "response": "First, we need to find out how many problems Faye can finish in an hour. We know that she can finish 3 math problems in an hour, so we can find the total number of problems she can finish by multiplying the number of math problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour.\n\n13 math problems \\* 3 problems per hour = <<13*3=39>>39 problems per hour\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours it will take Faye to finish all the problems. We know that she can finish 39 problems per hour, so we can find the total number of hours it will take her to finish all the problems by dividing the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish per hour.\n\n15 problems (total) / 39 problems per hour = <<15/39=0.38>>0.38 hours\n\nThe answer is 0.38 hours.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/361.png"}
