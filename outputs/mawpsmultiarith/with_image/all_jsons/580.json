{"question": "A company invited 24 people to a luncheon, but 10 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 7 people each, how many tables do they need?", "qid": "580", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tables needed for the remaining 14 people.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of people who didn't show up. In the image, it is 10.\n2. Next, we need to find the number of people who did show up. In the image, it is 24 - 10 = 14.\n3. Now, we need to find the number of tables needed for the 14 people who did show up. We can do this by dividing the number of people by the number of people per table.\n4. In the image, the number of people per table is 7. So, we divide 14 by 7 to get the number of tables needed:\n14 \u00f7 7 = 2\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/580.png"}
