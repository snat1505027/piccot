To do this, we can divide the number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package.\n\n68 cupcakes \u00f7 6 cupcakes per package = 11.33 packages\n\nSince Megan cannot make a fraction of a package, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of packages.\n\n11.33 packages rounded up to the nearest whole number = 12 packages\n\nThe answer is 12 packages.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/545.png"}
