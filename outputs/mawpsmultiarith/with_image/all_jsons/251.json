{"question": "There were 2 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total?", "qid": "251", "response": "The image shows a math problem with two equations. The first equation is \"Lives of the first two players = 6,\" and the second equation is \"Lives of the two new players = 6.\"\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the total number of lives for all four players. We can do this by combining the two equations.\n\nFirst, we can find the total number of lives for the first two players by multiplying the number of lives each player has by the number of players. In this case, it would be 3 lives per player, so the total number of lives for the first two players would be 3 x 2 = 6.\n\nNext, we can find the total number of lives for the two new players by multiplying the number of lives each player has by the number of new players. In this case, it would be 3 lives per player, so the total number of lives for the two new players would be 3 x 2 = 6.\n\nSince the total number of lives for both sets of players is the same, we can conclude that the total number of lives for all four players is 6.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/251.png"}
