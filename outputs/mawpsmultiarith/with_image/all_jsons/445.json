{"question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat free. If a group of 13 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?", "qid": "445", "response": "To find the total cost for the group to eat, we need to calculate the cost of the adult meals and the cost of the kids' meals.\n\n1. Total number of people: 13\n2. Number of kids: 9\n3. Cost per adult meal: $7\n4. Cost per kid meal: $0\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of adult meals. Since there are 13 people and 9 of them are kids, there are 4 adults.\n\n4 adult meals \\* $7 per meal = $<<4*7=28>>28\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of meals for the group. Since there are 13 people, we can add the number of adult meals and the number of kid meals.\n\nTotal meals = 4 adult meals + 9 kid meals = 13 meals\n\nFinally, we can find the total cost for the group to eat by multiplying the total number of meals by the cost per meal.\n\nTotal cost = 13 meals \\* $7 per meal = $<<13*7=91>>91\n\nThe answer is $91.", "answer": 28, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/445.png"}
