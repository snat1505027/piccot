{"question": "While playing a trivia game, Adam answered 8 questions correct in the first half and 2 questions correct in the second half. If each question was worth 8 points, what was his final score?", "qid": "273", "response": "In the image, there are two columns with the number of questions Adam answered correctly in each half. The first half column has the number 8, and the second half column has the number 2.\n\nTo calculate Adam's final score, we need to multiply the number of questions he answered correctly in each half by the number of points each question was worth. In this case, each question was worth 8 points.\n\nFor the first half, Adam answered 8 questions correctly, so his score for the first half is 8 \\* 8 = <<8*8=64>>64 points.\n\nFor the second half, Adam answered 2 questions correctly, so his score for the second half is 2 \\* 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 points.\n\nTo find Adam's final score, we add the scores from both halves: 64 + 16 = <<64+16=80>>80 points.\n\nThe answer is 80.", "answer": 80, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/273.png"}
