{"question": "Roger earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 14 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn?", "qid": "427", "response": "First, we need to find out how much Roger earned for each lawn he mowed. We know that he earned 9 dollars for each lawn.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many lawns Roger actually mowed. He had 14 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 8 of them. So, he mowed 14 - 8 = <<14-8=6>>6 lawns.\n\nFinally, we can calculate how much money Roger earned by multiplying the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earned per lawn. 6 lawns mowed \\* 9 dollars per lawn = <<6*9=54>>54 dollars.\n\nThe answer is $54.", "answer": 54, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/427.png"}
