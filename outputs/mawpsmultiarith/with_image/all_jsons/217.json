{"question": "Luke was putting his spare change into piles. He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. If each pile had 3 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?", "qid": "217", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of coins in the piles. We know that there are 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. Each pile of quarters has 3 coins, and each pile of dimes has 3 coins.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of quarters. There are 5 piles of quarters, and each pile has 3 coins. So, the total number of quarters is 5 x 3 = 15.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of dimes. There are 5 piles of dimes, and each pile has 3 coins. So, the total number of dimes is 5 x 3 = 15.\n\nNow, we can add the total number of quarters and dimes to find the total number of coins. The total number of coins is 15 + 15 = 30.\n\nThe answer is 30.", "answer": 30, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/217.png"}
