{"question": "Faye was playing a video game where she scores 7 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 on the second, what would her score be?", "qid": "220", "response": "To find Faye's score, we need to add the points she earned on each level.\n\nOn the first level, she found 2 treasures, which gives her 7 points per treasure, so her total score for the first level is 2 \\* 7 = 14 points.\n\nOn the second level, she found 6 treasures, which gives her 7 points per treasure, so her total score for the second level is 6 \\* 7 = 42 points.\n\nAdding the scores from both levels, we get 14 + 42 = 56 points.\n\nThe answer is 56.", "answer": 56, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/220.png"}
