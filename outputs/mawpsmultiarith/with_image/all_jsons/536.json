{"question": "There are 64 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 36 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 4 groups, how many students would be in each group?", "qid": "536", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in each group. First, we need to find the total number of students who didn't get picked for the team, which is 36. Then, we need to subtract that number from the total number of students trying out, which is 64.\n\n36 students didn't get picked for the team, so the total number of students in the 4 groups is 64 - 36 = 28.\n\nSince there are 4 groups, we need to divide the total number of students by 4 to find the number of students in each group.\n\n28 students / 4 groups = 7 students per group.\n\nThe answer is 7 students per group.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/536.png"}
