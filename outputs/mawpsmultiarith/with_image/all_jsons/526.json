{"question": "Wendy picked 103 flowers for her friend\u2019s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?", "qid": "526", "response": "First, we need to find the number of bouquets Wendy can still make using the remaining flowers. To do this, we need to find the number of flowers that were not wilted.\n\n103 - 47 = <<103-47=56>>56 flowers were not wilted.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of bouquets Wendy can make using these flowers. To do this, we need to divide the number of flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet.\n\n56 / 8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/526.png"}
