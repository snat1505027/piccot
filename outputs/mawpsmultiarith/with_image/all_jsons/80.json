{"question": "The school cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 5 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?", "qid": "80", "response": "The school cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students lunches. If only 5 students wanted fruit, the cafeteria would have 6 red apples and 15 green apples, making a total of 21 apples.\n\nSince the cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 5 students wanted fruit, the cafeteria has 6 red apples left over. To find the extra apples, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.\n\n6 red apples left over - 5 students wanting fruit = 1 extra red apple\n\nThe answer is 1 extra red apple.", "answer": 16, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/80.png"}
