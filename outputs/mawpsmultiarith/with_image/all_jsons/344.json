{"question": "Jerry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 8 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make?", "qid": "344", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up and the number of trips he will make.\n\n1. The number of trays from the first table is 9.\n2. The number of trays from the second table is 7.\n3. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up.\n\n1. Add the number of trays from the first table to the number of trays from the second table: 9 + 7 = 16.\n\nSince Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry:\n\n1. 16 \u00f7 8 = 2.\n\nThis means Jerry will make 2 trips to pick up all the trays.\n\nThe answer is 2.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/344.png"}
