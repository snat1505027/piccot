{"question": "A painter needed to paint 9 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?", "qid": "434", "response": "The painter has already painted 5 rooms, which means he has spent 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 hours painting.\nThe remaining rooms to paint are 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 rooms.\nTo find out how much longer it will take to paint the rest, we need to calculate the total time it will take to paint all 9 rooms.\nThe total time to paint all 9 rooms is 9 x 8 = <<9*8=72>>72 hours.\nSince the painter has already spent 40 hours painting 5 rooms, the remaining time to paint the rest is 72 - 40 = <<72-40=32>>32 hours.\nThe answer is 32 hours.", "answer": 32, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/434.png"}
