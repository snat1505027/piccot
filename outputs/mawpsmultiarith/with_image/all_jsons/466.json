{"question": "Gwen earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 4 bags, but didn't recycle 2 of them, how many points would she have earned?", "qid": "466", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of points Gwen would have earned if she had recycled all 4 bags of cans.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of points earned for each bag of cans. We know that Gwen earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total number of points Gwen would have earned if she had recycled all 4 bags of cans. To do this, we multiply the number of bags by the number of points earned per bag.\n\n4 bags \\* 8 points/bag = <<4*8=32>>32 points\n\n3. However, Gwen didn't recycle 2 of the bags, so we need to subtract the number of points she would have earned for those 2 bags from the total number of points she would have earned.\n\n32 points - 2 bags \\* 8 points/bag = <<32-16=16>>16 points\n\n4. Finally, we need to find the number of points Gwen actually earned. We know that she earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled, but we don't know how many bags she recycled. We can only determine the number of points she would have earned if she had recycled all 4 bags.\n\nThe answer is 16 points.", "answer": 16, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/466.png"}
