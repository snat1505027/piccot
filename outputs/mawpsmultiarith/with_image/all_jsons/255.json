{"question": "At Tom's Restaurant a group with 2 adults and 5 children came in to eat. If each meal cost 8 dollars, how much was the bill?", "qid": "255", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the meal for the group. We know that there are 2 adults and 5 children in the group. The cost of each meal is 8 dollars.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of meals. The total number of meals can be calculated by adding the number of adults and children. In this case, the total number of meals is 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nNext, we multiply the total number of meals by the cost per meal to find the total cost of the meal. 7 meals \\* 8 dollars per meal = 56 dollars.\n\nThe answer is 56 dollars.", "answer": 56, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/255.png"}
