{"question": "Chloe was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 6 treasures on the first level and 3 on the second, what would her score be?", "qid": "278", "response": "To find Chloe's score, we need to add the points she earned on each level.\n\nOn the first level, she found 6 treasures, which gives her 9 points per treasure, so her total score on the first level is 6 x 9 = 54 points.\n\nOn the second level, she found 3 treasures, which gives her 9 points per treasure, so her total score on the second level is 3 x 9 = 27 points.\n\nTo find her final score, we add the scores from both levels: 54 + 27 = 81 points.\n\nThe answer is 81.", "answer": 81, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/278.png"}
