{"question": "Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 48 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?", "qid": "565", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of pieces of clothing in the 9 small loads. We can do this by multiplying the number of pieces in one load by the number of loads.\n\n120 pieces of clothing \u00f7 9 loads = 13.33 pieces of clothing per load\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a piece of clothing, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n13.33 pieces of clothing \u00f7 9 loads = 14.88 pieces of clothing per load\n\nThe answer is 14.88.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/565.png"}
