{"question": "Tom had 5 books. If he sold 4 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Tom have?", "qid": "165", "response": "First, we need to find out how much money Tom earned from selling the 4 books. We can do this by multiplying the number of books sold by the price of each book.\n\n4 books sold \u00d7 $10 per book = $40 earned\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Tom spent on buying 38 new books. We can do this by multiplying the number of new books by the price of each book.\n\n38 new books \u00d7 $25 per book = $980 spent\n\nNow, we can find out how much money Tom has left by subtracting the amount he spent from the amount he earned.\n\n$40 earned - $980 spent = -$940\n\nSince Tom has a negative amount of money, we can conclude that he does not have any books left. The answer is 0 books.", "answer": 39, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/165.png"}
