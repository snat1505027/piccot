We can do this by adding the number of pieces each of them had.\n\nDebby had 32 pieces of candy.\nHer sister had 42 pieces of candy.\n\nSo, the total number of pieces of candy they had before eating any of it is:\n32 + 42 = 74\n\nThen, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy they have left after eating 35 pieces the first night. We can do this by subtracting the number of pieces they ate from the total number of pieces they had.\n\n74 - 35 = 39\n\nThe answer is 39.", "answer": 39, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/0.png"}
