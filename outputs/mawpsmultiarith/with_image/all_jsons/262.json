{"question": "Roger was putting his spare change into piles. He had 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. If each pile had 7 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?", "qid": "262", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of coins in the piles. We know that there are 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. Each pile of quarters has 7 coins, and each pile of dimes has 7 coins.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of quarters. There are 3 piles of quarters, and each pile has 7 coins. So, the total number of quarters is 3 x 7 = 21.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of dimes. There are 3 piles of dimes, and each pile has 7 coins. So, the total number of dimes is 3 x 7 = 21.\n\nNow, we have the total number of coins in the piles. There are 21 quarters and 21 dimes. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of quarters and dimes: 21 + 21 = 42.\n\nThe answer is 42.", "answer": 42, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/262.png"}
