{"question": "A store had 5 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 2 of the old ones and put 28 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?", "qid": "173", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of oranges in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and new ones were added.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of oranges that were thrown away. Since there were 5 oranges in the bin initially and 2 were thrown away, the number of oranges thrown away is 2.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of new oranges added to the bin. The number of new oranges added is 28.\n\nFinally, we need to add the number of oranges thrown away and the number of new oranges added to find the total number of oranges in the bin.\n\n2 (oranges thrown away) + 28 (new oranges added) = 30\n\nThe answer is 30.", "answer": 31, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/173.png"}
