{"question": "Paige picked 53 flowers for her friend\u2019s wedding. She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one. If 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?", "qid": "570", "response": "First, we need to find the number of bouquets Paige can make using the remaining flowers. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of bouquets = (Number of flowers - Number of wilted flowers) / Number of flowers per bouquet\n\nIn this case, the number of flowers is 53, and the number of wilted flowers is 18. So, we can calculate the number of bouquets as follows:\n\nNumber of bouquets = (53 - 18) / 7\nNumber of bouquets = 35 / 7\nNumber of bouquets = 5\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/570.png"}
