{"question": "Maria picked 48 carrots from her garden. If she threw out 11 of them and then picked 15 more the next day, how many carrots would she have total?", "qid": "112", "response": "First, we need to find the number of carrots Maria has after throwing out 11 of them. We can do this by subtracting 11 from the initial number of carrots she picked, which is 48.\n\n48 - 11 = 37\n\nNext, we need to find the number of carrots Maria has after picking 15 more the next day. We can do this by adding 15 to the number of carrots she has after throwing out 11, which is 37.\n\n37 + 15 = 52\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of carrots Maria has by adding the number of carrots she has after picking 15 more to the number of carrots she has after throwing out 11.\n\n52 + 37 = 89\n\nThe answer is 89.", "answer": 52, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/112.png"}
