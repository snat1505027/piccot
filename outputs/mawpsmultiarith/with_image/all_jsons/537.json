{"question": "Kaleb was selling his old games. He started out with 76 but sold 46 of them. He packed the rest up putting 5 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?", "qid": "537", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes Kaleb needed to store the remaining games.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of games Kaleb had left after selling 46 of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of games sold from the initial number of games:\n\n76 games - 46 games = <<76-46=30>>30 games left\n\nNext, we need to find the number of games per box. We know that Kaleb packed 5 games into each box.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of boxes needed to store the remaining 30 games. We can do this by dividing the number of games by the number of games per box:\n\n30 games / 5 games per box = <<30/5=6>>6 boxes needed\n\nThe answer is 6 boxes.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/537.png"}
