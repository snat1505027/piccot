{"question": "For homework Amy had 18 math problems and 6 spelling problems. If she can finish 4 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems?", "qid": "374", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours Amy will need to finish all the problems.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of problems Amy has to finish. There are 18 math problems and 6 spelling problems, so she has a total of 18 + 6 = 24 problems to finish.\n\nNext, we know that Amy can finish 4 problems in an hour. To find the total number of hours she will need, we can divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour:\n\n24 problems / 4 problems per hour = 6 hours\n\nThe answer is 6 hours.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/374.png"}
