{"question": "Sam was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 4 bags up and on Sunday he filled 3 more bags. If each bag had 6 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total?", "qid": "226", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cans collected by Sam.\n\nOn Saturday, Sam collected 4 bags with 6 cans in each bag, so he collected 4 x 6 = <<4*6=24>>24 cans on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday, Sam collected 3 bags with 6 cans in each bag, so he collected 3 x 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 cans on Sunday.\n\nTo find the total number of cans collected, we need to add the cans collected on Saturday and Sunday: 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 cans.\n\nThe answer is 42.", "answer": 42, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/226.png"}
