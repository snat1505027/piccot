{"question": "Wendy was playing a video game where she scores 5 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 4 treasures on the first level and 3 on the second, what would her score be?", "qid": "205", "response": "To find Wendy's score, we need to add the points she earned on each level.\n\nOn the first level, she found 4 treasures, which gives her 5 points per treasure, so her score would be 4 \\* 5 = 20 points.\n\nOn the second level, she found 3 treasures, which gives her 5 points per treasure, so her score would be 3 \\* 5 = 15 points.\n\nAdding the scores from both levels, we get 20 + 15 = 35 points.\n\nThe answer is 35.", "answer": 35, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/205.png"}
