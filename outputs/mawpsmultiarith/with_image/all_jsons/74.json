If only 10 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut?", "qid": "74", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students who didn't make the cut. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.\n\n1. First, we need to find the total number of students who tried out. We can do this by adding the number of girls and the number of boys who tried out.\n\n17 girls + 32 boys = 49 students\n\n2. Next, we need to find the number of students who got called back. We know that 10 students got called back, so we can subtract that number from the total number of students who tried out.\n\n49 students - 10 students = 39 students\n\n3. Finally, we need to find the number of students who didn't make the cut. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.\n\n39 students - 10 students = 29 students\n\nThe answer is 29 students.", "answer": 39, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/74.png"}
