{"question": "A painter needed to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?", "qid": "419", "response": "The painter has already painted 5 rooms, which means he has painted 1/12 of the rooms. To find out how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we need to find the time it takes to paint the remaining 7 rooms.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total time it takes to paint all 12 rooms. We can do this by multiplying the time it takes to paint each room by the total number of rooms:\n\n7 hours/room \u00d7 12 rooms = 84 hours\n\nNext, we can find the time it takes to paint the remaining 7 rooms by dividing the total time by the number of rooms already painted:\n\n84 hours \u00f7 5 rooms = 16.8 hours\n\nSince the painter has already painted 5 rooms, he will take 16.8 hours to paint the remaining 7 rooms. The answer is 16.8 hours.", "answer": 49, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/419.png"}
