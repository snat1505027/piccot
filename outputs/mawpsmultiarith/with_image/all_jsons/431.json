{"question": "At the fair Adam bought 13 tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had 4 tickets left. If each ticket cost 9 dollars, how much money did Adam spend riding the ferris wheel?", "qid": "431", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the tickets Adam used to ride the ferris wheel. We know that he bought 13 tickets and had 4 tickets left, so he used 13 - 4 = 9 tickets.\n\nThe cost of each ticket is $9, so the total cost of the tickets Adam used is 9 tickets \\* $9/ticket = $<<9*9=81>>81.\n\nThe answer is $81.", "answer": 81, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/431.png"}
