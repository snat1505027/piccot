{"question": "Faye was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 3 bead necklaces and 7 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 7 dollars, how much money did she earn?", "qid": "237", "response": "To find the total number of necklaces sold, we need to add the number of bead necklaces and gem stone necklaces.\n\n3 bead necklaces + 7 gem stone necklaces = 10 necklaces\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of the necklaces sold. We can do this by multiplying the number of necklaces by the cost per necklace.\n\n10 necklaces \u00d7 $7 per necklace = $<<10*7=70>>70\n\nFinally, we can find the total amount of money earned by subtracting the total cost of the necklaces from the total amount of money earned.\n\n$70 earned - $70 cost = $0 earned\n\nThe answer is $0.", "answer": 70, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/237.png"}
