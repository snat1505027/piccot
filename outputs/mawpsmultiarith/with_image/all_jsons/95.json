{"question": "Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 50 games from a friend and bought 27 more at a garage sale. If 74 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?", "qid": "95", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of games Ned bought. We can do this by adding the number of games he bought from his friend and the number of games he bought at the garage sale.\n\n50 games + 27 games = 77 games\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games.\n\n77 games - 74 games = 3 games\n\nThe answer is 3 games.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/95.png"}
