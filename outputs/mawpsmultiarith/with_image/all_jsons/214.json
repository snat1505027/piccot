{"question": "Paul was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 6 bags up and on Sunday he filled 3 more bags. If each bag had 8 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total?", "qid": "214", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cans collected by Paul.\n\nOn Saturday, Paul collected 6 bags, and each bag contained 8 cans. So, the total number of cans collected on Saturday is 6 bags x 8 cans per bag = 48 cans.\n\nOn Sunday, Paul collected 3 more bags, and each bag contained 8 cans. So, the total number of cans collected on Sunday is 3 bags x 8 cans per bag = 24 cans.\n\nTo find the total number of cans collected, we need to add the cans collected on Saturday and Sunday: 48 cans + 24 cans = 72 cans.\n\nThe answer is 72 cans.", "answer": 72, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/214.png"}
