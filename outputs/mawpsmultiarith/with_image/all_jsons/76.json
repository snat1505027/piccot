{"question": "A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 29 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 20 customers. If 34 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?", "qid": "76", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on. We can do this by adding the number of customers before the lunch rush and the number of customers added during the lunch rush.\n\n29 + 20 = 49\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of customers who didn't leave a tip. We can do this by subtracting the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.\n\n49 - 34 = 15\n\nFinally, we can find the number of customers who did leave a tip by subtracting the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.\n\n49 - 15 = 34\n\nThe answer is 34.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/76.png"}
