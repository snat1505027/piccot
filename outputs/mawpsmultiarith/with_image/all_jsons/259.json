{"question": "Rachel was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, what would her score be?", "qid": "259", "response": "Rachel's score would be 9 points for each treasure she finds, so we need to find the total points she would get for the treasures she found on both levels.\n\nOn the first level, she found 5 treasures, so she would get 9 points for each treasure, which is 5 x 9 = 45 points.\n\nOn the second level, she found 2 treasures, so she would get 9 points for each treasure, which is 2 x 9 = 18 points.\n\nAdding the points from both levels, Rachel's final score would be 45 + 18 = 63 points.\n\nThe answer is 63.", "answer": 63, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/259.png"}
