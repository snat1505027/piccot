{"question": "There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total?", "qid": "283", "response": "First, we need to find the number of lives each player had before the two new players joined. We can do this by dividing the total number of lives by the number of players.\n\n8 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game.\n\nTotal number of lives = 8 friends x 6 lives per friend = 48 lives\n\nNumber of players = 8 friends + 2 new players = 10 players\n\nNumber of lives per player = Total number of lives / Number of players = 48 / 10 = 4.8 lives per player\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of lives after the two new players joined. We can do this by multiplying the number of lives per player by the total number of players.\n\nTotal number of lives after the two new players joined = Number of lives per player x Total number of players = 4.8 x 10 = 48 lives\n\nThe answer is 48 lives.", "answer": 60, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/283.png"}
