{"question": "For a birthday party George bought 10 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 4 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?", "qid": "330", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many shelves George would fill up with the sodas he bought.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many sodas he bought in total. We can do this by adding the number of regular sodas and diet sodas he bought.\n\n10 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 32 sodas\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sodas can fit on each shelf. We know that each shelf can hold 4 sodas.\n\nSo, to find out how many shelves George would fill up, we need to divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas per shelf.\n\n32 sodas \u00f7 4 sodas per shelf = 8 shelves\n\nThe answer is 8 shelves.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/330.png"}
