{"question": "The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 42 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?", "qid": "63", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria. We can do this by adding the number of red apples and green apples: 8 + 43 = 51.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of apples wanted by the students. We can do this by multiplying the number of students by the number of apples per student: 42 students x 1 apple per student = 42 apples.\n\nSince the students wanted fewer apples than the cafeteria ordered, we need to find the difference between the total number of apples ordered and the total number of apples wanted by the students. The difference is 51 - 42 = 9.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of extra apples the cafeteria has. We can do this by subtracting the total number of apples wanted by the students from the total number of apples ordered: 51 - 42 = 9.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/63.png"}
