{"question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free. If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?", "qid": "411", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost for the group to eat. We know that each adult meal costs $3, and there are 12 people in the group. We also know that 7 of the people are kids, and they eat for free.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of adult meals. Since there are 12 people in the group, and 7 of them are kids, there are 5 adults. Therefore, the total number of adult meals is 5.\n\nNext, we multiply the number of adult meals by the cost per meal to find the total cost for the adults: 5 adult meals \\* $3 per meal = $<<5*3=15>>15.\n\nSince the kids eat for free, we don't need to include them in the total cost calculation. The total cost for the group to eat is $15.\n\nThe answer is $15.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/411.png"}
