{"question": "Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?", "qid": "342", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pictures in each album. First, we need to find the total number of pictures that Olivia uploaded. The image shows that she uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera, so the total number of pictures is 5 + 35 = 40.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. The image shows that there are 8 albums, so we need to divide 40 by 8. 40 \u00f7 8 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that each album contains 5 pictures.\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/342.png"}
