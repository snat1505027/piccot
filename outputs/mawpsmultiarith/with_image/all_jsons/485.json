{"question": "Tiffany baked 8 brownies, but needed 17 total for her party. If she used 8 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?", "qid": "485", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cups of flour Tiffany still needs. We know that she baked 8 brownies and needed 17 total for her party. We can start by calculating the total number of cups of flour she used:\n\n8 brownies \\* 8 cups of flour per brownie = 64 cups of flour used\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to reach 17 brownies. We can do this by subtracting the total flour used from the total flour needed:\n\n17 brownies - 64 cups of flour used = 83 cups of flour needed\n\nSince Tiffany already used 64 cups of flour, she still needs 83 cups of flour - 64 cups of flour = 19 cups of flour still needed.\n\nThe answer is 19 cups of flour still needed.", "answer": 72, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/485.png"}
