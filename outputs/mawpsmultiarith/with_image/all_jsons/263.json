{"question": "There were 2 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?", "qid": "263", "response": "The image shows a math problem with two equations. The first equation is \"Lives of the first two players = 16\". The second equation is \"Lives of the two new players = 16\".\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the total number of lives for all four players. We can do this by combining the two equations.\n\nFirst, we can substitute the value of 16 from the second equation into the first equation, which gives us \"Lives of the first two players = Lives of the two new players\".\n\nNext, we can simplify the equation by removing the word \"Lives\" from both sides, which gives us \"First two players = New players\".\n\nFinally, we can substitute the word \"players\" with \"lives\" to get the answer, which gives us \"First two lives = New lives\".\n\nThe answer is 16.", "answer": 32, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/263.png"}
