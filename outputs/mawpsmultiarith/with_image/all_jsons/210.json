{"question": "Rachel was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 7 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 3 scarves and 4 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Rachel have total?", "qid": "210", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of scarves. There are 7 boxes, and each box contains 3 scarves. So, the total number of scarves is 7 x 3 = 21.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of mittens. There are 7 boxes, and each box contains 4 mittens. So, the total number of mittens is 7 x 4 = 28.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing. We can add the total number of scarves and mittens to get the answer. The total number of pieces of winter clothing is 21 scarves + 28 mittens = 51.\n\nThe answer is 51.", "answer": 49, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/210.png"}
