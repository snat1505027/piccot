{"question": "There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 3 players quit. If each player left had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total?", "qid": "497", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of lives the remaining players have. Since there are 8 friends playing and 3 players quit, the remaining players are 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of lives each remaining player had. Since each player who quit had 3 lives, we can assume that each remaining player also had 3 lives.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of lives by multiplying the number of remaining players by the number of lives each player had: 5 players \\* 3 lives/player = 15 lives.\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 15, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/497.png"}
