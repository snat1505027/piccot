{"question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?", "qid": "478", "response": "To find the total cost for the group to eat, we need to calculate the cost per adult and multiply it by the number of adults. We also need to calculate the cost per child and multiply it by the number of children.\n\n1. Total number of people: 15\n2. Number of adults: 6 (15 - 9)\n3. Cost per adult meal: $2\n4. Total cost for adults: 6 x $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12\n\n1. Number of kids: 9\n2. Cost per child meal: $0 (free)\n3. Total cost for kids: 9 x $0 = $<<9*0=0>>0\n\n1. Total cost for the group to eat: $12 + $0 = $<<12+0=12>>12\n\nThe answer is $12.", "answer": 12, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/478.png"}
