{"question": "A pet store had 64 puppies. In one day they sold 28 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use?", "qid": "522", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cages were used to hold the remaining puppies. First, we need to find out how many puppies were left after selling 28 of them. We can do this by subtracting 28 from 64.\n\n64 - 28 = 36\n\nNext, we need to find out how many puppies can fit in a cage. We know that there are 4 puppies in each cage.\n\nNow, we can find out how many cages were used by dividing the number of puppies left (36) by the number of puppies per cage (4).\n\n36 \u00f7 4 = 9\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/522.png"}
