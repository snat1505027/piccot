{"question": "April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. If Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, how much did she spend?", "qid": "203", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount spent by Emily. We know that each rose costs 3 dollars, and she bought 2 roses. We also know that each daisy costs 2 dollars, and she bought 2 daisies.\n\nFirst, we need to find the cost of the roses. Since Emily bought 2 roses, the cost would be 2 x 3 = 6 dollars.\n\nNext, we need to find the cost of the daisies. Since Emily bought 2 daisies, the cost would be 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.\n\nNow, we can find the total amount spent by adding the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies: 6 + 4 = 10 dollars.\n\nThe answer is 10 dollars.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/203.png"}
