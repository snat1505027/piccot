{"question": "Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash?", "qid": "9", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total number of shirts washed and the total number of shirts that should have been washed.\n\nTotal shirts washed: 9 short sleeve shirts + 21 long sleeve shirts = 30 shirts\n\nTotal shirts that should have been washed: 9 short sleeve shirts + 21 long sleeve shirts = 30 shirts\n\nSince the number of shirts washed is equal to the number of shirts that should have been washed, we can conclude that Ned washed all the shirts.\n\nThe answer is 0.", "answer": 1, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/9.png"}
