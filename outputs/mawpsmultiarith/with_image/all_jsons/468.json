{"question": "A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already cooked 8. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?", "qid": "468", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it will take the chef to cook the remaining 7 potatoes.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of potatoes that will be cooked. We can do this by adding the number of potatoes already cooked (8) to the number of potatoes left to cook (7).\n\n8 + 7 = 15\n\nNext, we need to find the total time it will take to cook all 15 potatoes. We can do this by multiplying the time it takes to cook each potato (9 minutes) by the total number of potatoes (15).\n\n9 minutes/potato \u00d7 15 potatoes = 135 minutes\n\nThe answer is 135 minutes.", "answer": 63, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/468.png"}
