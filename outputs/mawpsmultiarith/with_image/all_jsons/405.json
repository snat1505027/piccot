{"question": "A trivia team had 5 members total, but during a game 2 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 6 points, how many points were scored total?", "qid": "405", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of points scored by the trivia team. We know that there are 5 members in total, and 2 of them didn't show up. So, we can find the total number of points scored by the remaining 3 members.\n\nLet's assume that the remaining 3 members scored x points each. Then, the total number of points scored by the remaining members would be 3x.\n\nSince each member who showed up scored 6 points, we can find the total number of points scored by the entire team by adding the points scored by the remaining members to the points scored by the members who showed up.\n\nThe total number of points scored by the entire team would be:\n\n3x + 6(3) = 3x + 18\n\nThe answer is 3x + 18.", "answer": 18, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/405.png"}
