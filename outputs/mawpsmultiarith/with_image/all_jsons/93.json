{"question": "While shopping, Emily bought 5 green towels and 30 white towels. If she gave her mother 26 of them, how many towels did Emily end up with?", "qid": "93", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of towels Emily bought. We can do this by adding the number of green towels and white towels she bought.\n\n5 green towels + 30 white towels = 35 towels\n\nNext, we need to find the number of towels Emily gave to her mother. We know that she gave 26 towels to her mother.\n\n35 towels - 26 towels = 9 towels\n\nFinally, we can find the number of towels Emily ended up with by subtracting the number of towels she gave to her mother from the total number of towels she bought.\n\n9 towels = 35 towels - 26 towels\n\nThe answer is 9 towels.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/93.png"}
