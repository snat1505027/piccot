She finished 32 of them, leaving her with 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, we can find the number of problems per page by dividing the total number of problems by the number of pages.\n\n72 problems \u00f7 5 pages = 14.4 problems per page\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a problem, we need to round the number of problems per page to the nearest whole number.\n\n14.4 problems per page \u2248 15 problems per page\n\nThe answer is 15.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/507.png"}
