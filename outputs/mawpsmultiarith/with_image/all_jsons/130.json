We can do this by subtracting 6 from 45:\n\n45 - 6 = 41\n\nNext, we need to find the number of coloring books Bianca has after buying 20 more. We can do this by adding 20 to the number of coloring books she has after giving away 6:\n\n41 + 20 = 61\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of coloring books Bianca has after buying 20 more. We can do this by adding the number of coloring books she has after buying 20 more to the number of coloring books she had before buying 20 more:\n\n61 + 41 = 102\n\nThe answer is 102.", "answer": 59, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/130.png"}
