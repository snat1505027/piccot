We can do this by subtracting 10 from 46:\n\n46 - 10 = 36\n\nNext, we need to find the number of shelves Oliver will need to store the remaining books. We can do this by dividing the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n\n36 \u00f7 4 = 9\n\nThe answer is 9 shelves.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/511.png"}
