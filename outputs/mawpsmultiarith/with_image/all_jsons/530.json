{"question": "A pet store had 78 puppies. In one day they sold 30 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage. How many cages did they use?", "qid": "530", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cages used. First, we need to find the number of puppies left in the cages. Since there are 78 puppies and 30 were sold, there are 78 - 30 = <<78-30=48>>48 puppies left.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of puppies per cage. Since there are 48 puppies and 8 in each cage, we can divide 48 by 8 to find the number of cages needed. 48 \u00f7 8 = <<48/8=6>>6 cages.\n\nTherefore, the pet store used 6 cages to hold the remaining puppies.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/530.png"}
