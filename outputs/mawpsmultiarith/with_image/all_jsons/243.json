{"question": "Amy was playing a video game where she scores 4 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 6 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, what would her score be?", "qid": "243", "response": "To find Amy's score, we need to add the points she earned on each level. On the first level, she found 6 treasures, so she earned 4 points per treasure, which is 6 x 4 = 24 points. On the second level, she found 2 treasures, so she earned 4 points per treasure, which is 2 x 4 = 8 points.\n\nTo find the total score, we add the points from both levels: 24 + 8 = 32 points.\n\nThe answer is 32 points.", "answer": 32, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/243.png"}
