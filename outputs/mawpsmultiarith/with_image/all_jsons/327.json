{"question": "A pet shelter had 5 puppies when another 35 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?", "qid": "327", "response": "First, we need to find out how many puppies are in the shelter after the 35 were brought in. We can do this by adding the number of puppies brought in to the number of puppies already in the shelter.\n\n5 puppies + 35 puppies = 40 puppies\n\nNext, we need to find out how many puppies are adopted each day. The image shows that 8 puppies are adopted each day.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies. We can use the number of puppies in the shelter and the number of puppies adopted each day to find the answer.\n\n40 puppies - 8 puppies adopted each day = x days\n\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 8.\n\n5 days = x\n\nThe answer is 5 days.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/327.png"}
