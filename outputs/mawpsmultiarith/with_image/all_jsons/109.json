{"question": "At the fair there were 9 people in line for the bumper cars. If 6 of them got tired of waiting and left and 3 more got in line, how many people would be in line?", "qid": "109", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people who are still in line after the 6 people left and the 3 people got in line.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of people who got tired of waiting and left. We can do this by subtracting the number of people who got tired of waiting from the initial number of people in line.\n\n9 people in line - 6 people who got tired of waiting = 3 people who didn't get tired of waiting\n\nNext, we need to find the number of people who got in line after the 6 people left. We can do this by adding the number of people who got in line to the number of people who didn't get tired of waiting.\n\n3 people who didn't get tired of waiting + 3 people who got in line = 6 people in line\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of people in line after the 6 people left and the 3 people got in line. We can do this by adding the number of people who didn't get tired of waiting and the number of people who got in line.\n\n6 people in line = 3 people who didn't get tired of waiting + 3 people who got in line\n\nThe answer is 6 people in line.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/109.png"}
