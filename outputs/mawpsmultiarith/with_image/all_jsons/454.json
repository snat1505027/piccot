{"question": "John earned 8 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 15 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them, how much money did he actually earn?", "qid": "454", "response": "First, we need to find the number of lawns John mowed. We know that he earned 8 dollars for each lawn, so we can calculate the total number of lawns he mowed by multiplying the number of lawns by the amount he earned per lawn:\n\n15 lawns mowed \\* 8 dollars per lawn = 120 dollars earned\n\nNext, we need to find the number of lawns John forgot to mow. We know that he forgot to mow 7 lawns, so we can subtract the number of lawns he forgot from the total number of lawns:\n\n15 lawns mowed - 7 lawns forgotten = 8 lawns mowed\n\nFinally, we can calculate the amount of money John actually earned by multiplying the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earned per lawn:\n\n8 lawns mowed \\* 8 dollars per lawn = 64 dollars earned\n\nThe answer is $64.", "answer": 64, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/454.png"}
