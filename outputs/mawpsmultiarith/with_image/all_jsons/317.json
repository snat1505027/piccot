{"question": "Wendy's old washing machine could only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?", "qid": "317", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many loads Wendy would have to do to wash all the clothes.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many shirts and sweaters can be washed together. Since the washing machine can wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time, we can wash 8 shirts or 8 sweaters at a time.\n\nSince there are 39 shirts and 33 sweaters, we can wash 8 shirts and 8 sweaters at a time.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many loads we would need to do to wash all the clothes.\n\nTo do this, we need to divide the total number of shirts and sweaters by the number of pieces that can be washed together.\n\n39 shirts \u00f7 8 pieces per load = 4.875 loads\n33 sweaters \u00f7 8 pieces per load = 4.125 loads\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a load, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of loads.\n\nSo, Wendy would have to do 5 loads to wash all the clothes.\n\nThe answer is 5.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/317.png"}
