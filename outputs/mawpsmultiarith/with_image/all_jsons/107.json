{"question": "A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin. If they sold 33 books, but then put 2 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?", "qid": "107", "response": "First, we need to find the number of books that were initially in the bargain bin. We know that 41 books were initially in the bin, and 33 books were sold. So, the number of books left in the bin is 41 - 33 = 8.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of books that were added back to the bin. We know that 2 books were added back to the bin.\n\nNow, we can add the number of books that were initially in the bin and the number of books that were added back to the bin to find the total number of books in the bin. The total number of books in the bin is 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nThe answer is 10.", "answer": 10, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/107.png"}
