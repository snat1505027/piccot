{"question": "Rachel was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 9 books on it. If she had 6 shelves of mystery books and 2 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?", "qid": "209", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of books Rachel has. We know that she has 6 shelves of mystery books and 2 shelves of picture books. We can find the total number of books by adding the number of books on each shelf.\n\nFor the mystery books, we can find the total number of books by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf. We know that there are 9 books per shelf, so we can write:\n\n6 shelves of mystery books \u00d7 9 books per shelf = 54 books\n\nFor the picture books, we can find the total number of books by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf. We know that there are 2 shelves of picture books, and we don't know the number of books per shelf, so we can write:\n\n2 shelves of picture books \u00d7 <number of books per shelf> = <total number of picture books>\n\nSince we don't know the number of books per shelf, we cannot calculate the total number of picture books.\n\nTo find the total number of books, we can add the total number of mystery books and the total number of picture books. We know that the total number of books is 54, so we can write:\n\n54 books (total) = 54 books (mystery books) + <total number of picture books>\n\nThe answer is 54 books.", "answer": 72, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/209.png"}
