{"question": "Zoe baked 5 brownies, but needed 11 total for her party. If she used 7 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?", "qid": "463", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cups of flour Zoe still needs. We know that she baked 5 brownies, but needed 11 total for her party. We also know that she used 7 cups of flour on each one.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many brownies she needs to bake to reach the total of 11. To do this, we can divide the total number of brownies needed by the number of brownies she has already baked:\n\n11 (total) / 5 (brownies baked) = 2.2\n\nSince Zoe needs to bake 2 more brownies to reach the total of 11, we can find out how much flour she will need for those 2 brownies by multiplying the amount of flour used per brownie by the number of brownies she needs to bake:\n\n7 cups of flour per brownie \\* 2 brownies = 14 cups of flour\n\nNow, we can add the flour used for the 5 brownies she has already baked to the flour needed for the 2 additional brownies:\n\n14 cups of flour (needed for 2 more brownies) + 7 cups of flour (used for 5 brownies) = 21 cups of flour\n\nThe answer is 21 cups of flour.", "answer": 42, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/463.png"}
