{"question": "A waiter had 9 tables he was waiting on, with 7 women and 3 men at each table. How many customers total did the waiter have?", "qid": "202", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of customers. We can do this by multiplying the number of tables (9) by the number of customers per table (7 women and 3 men).\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of women customers. We can do this by multiplying the number of tables (9) by the number of women per table (7).\n\n9 tables x 7 women per table = 63 women customers\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of men customers. We can do this by multiplying the number of tables (9) by the number of men per table (3).\n\n9 tables x 3 men per table = 27 men customers\n\nNow, we have the total number of women customers (63) and the total number of men customers (27). To find the total number of customers, we need to add these two numbers together.\n\n63 women customers + 27 men customers = 90 customers\n\nThe answer is 90.", "answer": 90, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/202.png"}
