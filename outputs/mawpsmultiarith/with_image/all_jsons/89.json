{"question": "A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?", "qid": "89", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on. We can do this by adding the number of customers before the lunch rush and the number of customers added during the lunch rush.\n\n39 + 12 = 51\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of customers who didn't leave a tip. This is the number of customers who left a tip, which is 49, minus the number of customers who didn't leave a tip, which is 49.\n\n49 - 49 = 0\n\nSince the number of customers who didn't leave a tip is 0, it means that all 51 customers left a tip.\n\nThe answer is 51.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/89.png"}
