{"question": "A painter needed to paint 10 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 8 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?", "qid": "406", "response": "The painter has already painted 8 rooms, which means he has painted 8/10 of the rooms. To find out how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we need to find the time it takes to paint the remaining 2 rooms.\n\nThe time it takes to paint a room is 8 hours. To find the time it takes to paint 2 rooms, we can multiply the time it takes to paint a room by the number of rooms to be painted:\n\n8 hours/room \\* 2 rooms = 16 hours\n\nSince the painter has already painted 8 rooms, he has 2 rooms left to paint. Therefore, the time it will take him to paint the remaining 2 rooms is 16 hours.\n\nThe answer is 16 hours.", "answer": 16, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/406.png"}
