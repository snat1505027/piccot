{"question": "Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?", "qid": "523", "response": "First, we need to find out how many games Edward has left after selling 19 of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of games sold from the initial number of games.\n\n35 - 19 = 16\n\nNext, we need to find out how many games are in each box. We know that there are 8 games in each box.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many boxes Edward needs to use to store the remaining games. We can do this by dividing the number of games left by the number of games per box.\n\n16 / 8 = 2\n\nThe answer is 2 boxes.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/523.png"}
