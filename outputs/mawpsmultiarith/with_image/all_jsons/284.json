{"question": "Sam was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 3 bags up and on Sunday he filled 4 more bags. If each bag had 9 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total?", "qid": "284", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cans collected by Sam. We can do this by adding the number of cans in each bag on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, Sam filled 3 bags, and each bag contained 9 cans. So, the total number of cans collected on Saturday is 3 bags x 9 cans per bag = 27 cans.\n\nOn Sunday, Sam filled 4 more bags, and each bag contained 9 cans. So, the total number of cans collected on Sunday is 4 bags x 9 cans per bag = 36 cans.\n\nTo find the total number of cans collected, we need to add the cans collected on Saturday and Sunday: 27 cans + 36 cans = 63 cans.\n\nThe answer is 63 cans.", "answer": 63, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/284.png"}
