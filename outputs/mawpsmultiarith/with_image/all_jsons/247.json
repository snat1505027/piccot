{"question": "At Oliver's Restaurant a group with 2 adults and 4 children came in to eat. If each meal cost 3 dollars, how much was the bill?", "qid": "247", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the meal for the group. We know that there are 2 adults and 4 children in the group. The cost of each meal is $3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of meals. The total number of meals is the sum of the number of adult meals and the number of child meals. In this case, the total number of meals is 2 (adults) + 4 (children) = 6.\n\nNext, we multiply the total number of meals by the cost per meal to find the total cost of the meal. The total cost of the meal is 6 meals \\* $3 per meal = $<<6*3=18>>18.\n\nThe answer is $18.", "answer": 18, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/247.png"}
