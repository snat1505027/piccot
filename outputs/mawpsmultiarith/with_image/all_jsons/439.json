{"question": "A magician was selling magic card decks for 9 dollars each. If he started with 12 decks and by the end of the day he had 7 left, how much money did he earn?", "qid": "439", "response": "The magician started with 12 decks, and he had 7 left at the end of the day. We need to find out how many decks he sold. Let's call the number of decks sold x.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\n12 (starting decks) - x (decks sold) = 7 (remaining decks)\n\nNow, we can solve the equation:\n\n12 - x = 7\n\nAdd 7 to both sides of the equation:\n\n12 - x = 14\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 2\n\nThe magician sold 2 decks, and he earned 9 dollars per deck. So, he earned 9 x 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18.\n\nThe answer is $18.", "answer": 45, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/439.png"}
