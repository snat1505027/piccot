{"question": "Roger had 25 books. If he sold 21 of them and used the money he earned to buy 30 new books, how many books would Roger have?", "qid": "195", "response": "First, we need to find out how much money Roger earned from selling the 21 books. We can do this by multiplying the number of books sold by the price of each book.\n\n21 books sold \u00d7 $22 per book = $<<21*22=442>>442\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Roger spent on the 30 new books. We can do this by multiplying the number of new books by the price of each book.\n\n30 new books \u00d7 $22 per book = $<<30*22=660>>660\n\nNow, we can find out how much money Roger has left by subtracting the amount he spent on new books from the amount he earned from selling the old books.\n\n$442 - $660 = $<<442-660=-218>>-218\n\nSince Roger spent more money on new books than he earned from selling the old books, he now has fewer books than he started with.\n\nRoger had 25 books initially, and he sold 21 of them. This means he has 25 - 21 = <<25-21=4>>4 books left.\n\nThe answer is 4.", "answer": 34, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/195.png"}
