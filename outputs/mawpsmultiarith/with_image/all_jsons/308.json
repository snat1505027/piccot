{"question": "For homework Nancy had 17 math problems and 15 spelling problems. If she can finish 8 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems?", "qid": "308", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Nancy will take to finish all the problems.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of problems Nancy has to finish. We can do this by adding the number of math problems and spelling problems: 17 + 15 = 32.\n\nNext, we need to find the total time Nancy will take to finish one problem. We know that she can finish 8 problems in an hour, so we can divide the number of problems by the number of hours it takes her to finish one problem: 32 / 8 = 4.\n\nFinally, we can multiply the total time it takes to finish one problem by the total number of problems to find the total time it will take Nancy to finish all the problems: 4 x 32 = 128.\n\nThe answer is 128.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/308.png"}
