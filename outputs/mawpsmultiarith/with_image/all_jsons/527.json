{"question": "Kaleb had 39 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 19 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?", "qid": "527", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of pieces of clothing that can go in the small loads. We know that Kaleb put 19 pieces of clothing in one load, and he decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. To find the total number of pieces of clothing that can go in the small loads, we need to divide the remaining pieces by 5.\n\n39 (total pieces) - 19 (pieces in one load) = <<39-19=20>>20 pieces left to distribute\n\n20 (pieces left) \u00f7 5 (loads) = <<20/5=4>>4 pieces per small load\n\nThe answer is 4 pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/527.png"}
