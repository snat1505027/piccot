{"question": "Luke was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, how many trips will he make?", "qid": "384", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of trays Luke will pick up from both tables and then divide that by the number of trays he can carry at a time.\n\nFirst, we add the number of trays from the first table (20) and the number of trays from the second table (16): 20 + 16 = 36.\n\nNext, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Luke can carry at a time: 36 \u00f7 4 = 9.\n\nSince Luke can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will need to make 9 trips to pick up all the trays.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/384.png"}
