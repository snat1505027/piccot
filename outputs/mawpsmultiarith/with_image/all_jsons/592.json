{"question": "Luke was selling his old games. He started out with 57 but sold 39 of them. He packed the rest up putting 2 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?", "qid": "592", "response": "First, we need to find out the number of games Luke had left after selling 39 of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of games sold from the initial number of games.\n\n57 games - 39 games = <<57-39=18>>18 games left\n\nNext, we need to find out how many games Luke packed into each box. We know that he packed 2 games into each box.\n\n18 games / 2 games per box = <<18/2=9>>9 boxes\n\nFinally, we need to find out the number of boxes Luke used. We can do this by multiplying the number of games left by the number of games per box.\n\n9 boxes \\* 2 games per box = <<9*2=18>>18 boxes\n\nThe answer is 18 boxes.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/592.png"}
