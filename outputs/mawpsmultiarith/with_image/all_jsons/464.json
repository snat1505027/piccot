{"question": "A painter needed to paint 6 rooms in a building. Each room takes 5 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?", "qid": "464", "response": "The painter has already painted 2 rooms, which means he has painted 2/6 of the rooms. To find out how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we need to find the time it takes to paint one room.\n\nThe time it takes to paint one room is 5 hours. To find the time it takes to paint the remaining 4 rooms, we can divide the total time by the number of rooms already painted.\n\n5 hours per room / 2 rooms already painted = 2.5 hours per room\n\nSince the painter has already painted 2 rooms, he will take 2.5 hours per room to paint the remaining 4 rooms. To find the total time, we multiply the time per room by the number of rooms left to paint.\n\n2.5 hours per room x 4 rooms left to paint = 10 hours\n\nThe answer is 10 hours.", "answer": 20, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/464.png"}
