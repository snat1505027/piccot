{"question": "April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. If Zoe bought 8 roses and 2 daisies, how much did she spend?", "qid": "224", "response": "To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the roses and the daisies separately and then add them up.\n\n1. The cost of the roses is 8 x $3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.\n2. The cost of the daisies is 2 x $3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.\n\nNow, we add the costs of the roses and the daisies to find the total amount spent: $24 + $6 = $<<24+6=30>>30.\n\nThe answer is $30.", "answer": 30, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/224.png"}
