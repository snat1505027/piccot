We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Number of friends: 9\n2. Number of friends who couldn't come: 6\n\nWe need to find the total number of cupcakes for all the friends, including those who couldn't come.\n\nTotal number of cupcakes = Number of friends + Number of friends who couldn't come\nTotal number of cupcakes = 9 + 6\nTotal number of cupcakes = 15\n\nNow, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per person to find the exact number of cupcakes Sam should buy.\n\nNumber of cupcakes per person = 2\nExact number of cupcakes Sam should buy = Total number of cupcakes / Number of cupcakes per person\nExact number of cupcakes Sam should buy = 15 / 2\nExact number of cupcakes Sam should buy = 7.5\n\nThe answer is 7.5.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/498.png"}
