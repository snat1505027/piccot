{"question": "There were 16 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit. If each player left had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?", "qid": "414", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of lives the remaining players have. First, we need to find the number of lives each player had before they quit. We can do this by multiplying the number of players who quit by the number of lives each player had.\n\n16 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit.\n\n16 - 7 = 9 players remaining.\n\n7 players who quit had 8 lives each.\n\n7 x 8 = 56 lives.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of lives the remaining players have. We can do this by adding the number of lives the remaining players had before the game to the number of lives the players who quit had.\n\n9 players remaining had 8 lives each.\n\n9 x 8 = 72 lives.\n\n56 lives + 72 lives = 128 lives.\n\nThe answer is 128.", "answer": 72, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/414.png"}
