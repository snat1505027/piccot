{"question": "While playing at the arcade, Ned won 26 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 19 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 9 tickets a piece, how many could he buy?", "qid": "383", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many tickets Ned has in total. We can do this by adding the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'.\n\n26 tickets (whack a mole) + 19 tickets (skee ball) = 45 tickets\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pieces of candy Ned can buy with 45 tickets. We know that each piece of candy costs 9 tickets.\n\n45 tickets / 9 tickets per piece = 5 pieces of candy\n\nThe answer is 5 pieces of candy.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/383.png"}
