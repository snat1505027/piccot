{"question": "There were 6 girls and 48 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 7 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut?", "qid": "68", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students who didn't make the cut. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of students who tried out. We can do this by adding the number of girls and the number of boys who tried out.\n\nGirls: 6\nBoys: 48\nTotal students: 6 + 48 = 54\n\nNext, we need to find the number of students who got called back. We know that 7 students got called back, so we can subtract that number from the total number of students who tried out.\n\nTotal students called back: 7\nTotal students not called back: 54 - 7 = 47\n\nThe answer is 47.", "answer": 47, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/68.png"}
