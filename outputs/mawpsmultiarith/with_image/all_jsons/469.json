{"question": "A trivia team had 14 members total, but during a game 7 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 5 points, how many points were scored total?", "qid": "469", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total points scored by the trivia team members who did show up. We can do this by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of members who showed up. We know that 14 members were in the trivia team, but 7 members didn't show up. So, the number of members who showed up is 14 - 7 = 7.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total points scored by the members who showed up. We know that each member who showed up scored 5 points. So, the total points scored by the members who showed up is 7 members \\* 5 points per member = 35 points.\n\n3. Finally, we need to add the total points scored by the members who didn't show up to the total points scored by the members who did show up. We know that 7 members didn't show up, but we don't know how many points they would have scored if they had shown up. So, we cannot add their potential points to the total points scored by the members who did show up.\n\nThe answer is 35 points.", "answer": 35, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/469.png"}
