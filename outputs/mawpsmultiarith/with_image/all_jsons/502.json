{"question": "Luke had 47 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 17 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?", "qid": "502", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of pieces of clothing that can go in the small loads. We know that Luke put 17 pieces of clothing in one load, and he decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. To find the total number of pieces of clothing that can go in the small loads, we need to divide the remaining pieces by 5.\n\n47 (total pieces) - 17 (pieces in one load) = <<47-17=30>>30 pieces of clothing to be split into 5 equal loads.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of pieces of clothing that can go in each small load. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 5.\n\n30 (total pieces) \u00f7 5 (loads) = <<30/5=6>>6 pieces of clothing in each small load.\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/502.png"}
