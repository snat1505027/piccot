{"question": "Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?", "qid": "321", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how long Mike's money will last him if he spends $5 a week.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much money Mike made in total. We can do this by adding the amount he made from mowing lawns and the amount he made from weed eating.\n\n14 + 26 = 40\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Mike has in total. We can do this by multiplying the amount he made by the number of weeks he can spend it.\n\n40 x 5 = 200\n\nSince Mike made $40 and can spend it for 5 weeks, he has a total of $200.\n\nThe answer is 200.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/321.png"}
