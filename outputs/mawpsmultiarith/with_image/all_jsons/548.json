{"question": "Sarah had 60 homework problems. She finished 20 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?", "qid": "548", "response": "First, we need to find the number of problems on each page. Let's call this number x.\n\nWe know that Sarah had 60 problems in total, and she finished 20 of them. This means she has 60 - 20 = <<60-20=40>>40 problems left to do.\n\nSince each page has the same number of problems, we can say that the number of problems on each page is equal to the number of problems left to do, which is 40.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 40 problems per page.", "answer": 8, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/548.png"}
