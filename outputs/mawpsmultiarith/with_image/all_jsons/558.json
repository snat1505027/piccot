{"question": "The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make?", "qid": "558", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples are left after giving 5 apples to students. We can do this by subtracting 5 from the initial number of apples, which is 50.\n\n50 apples - 5 apples = 45 apples\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pies can be made using these 45 apples. Since each pie requires 5 apples, we can divide the number of apples by the number of apples per pie.\n\n45 apples \u00f7 5 apples per pie = 9 pies\n\nThe answer is 9 pies.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/558.png"}
