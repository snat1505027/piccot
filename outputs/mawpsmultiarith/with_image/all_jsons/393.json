{"question": "For a birthday party Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 7 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?", "qid": "393", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many shelves Tom would need to fill up with regular sodas and diet sodas.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many regular sodas Tom bought. The image shows that he bought 4 regular sodas.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many shelves he would need to fill up with regular sodas. Since he bought 4 regular sodas and the fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf, he would need to fill up 4/7 shelves.\n\nTo find the answer, we can divide 4 by 7 and multiply the result by 7.\n\n4/7 \\* 7 = 4.2857\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n4.2857 rounded up to the nearest whole number is 5.\n\nSo, Tom would need to fill up 5 shelves with regular sodas.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many shelves he would need to fill up with diet sodas. The image shows that he bought 52 diet sodas.\n\nSince the fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf, we can divide 52 by 7 to find out how many shelves he would need to fill up with diet sodas.\n\n52/7 = 7.42857\n\nAgain, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n7.42857 rounded up to the nearest whole number is 8.\n\nSo, Tom would need to fill up 8 shelves with diet sodas.\n\nIn summary, Tom would need to fill up 5 shelves with regular sodas and 8 shelves with diet sodas.\n\nThe answer is 5 shelves filled with regular sodas and 8 shelves filled with diet sodas.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/393.png"}
