{"question": "A worksheet had 3 problems on it. If a teacher had 15 worksheets to grade and had already graded 7 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade?", "qid": "474", "response": "The image shows a math problem with a total number of problems, a number of problems per worksheet, and the number of worksheets already graded. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of problems left to grade.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of problems on all worksheets. The image shows that there are 3 problems per worksheet, and 15 worksheets have already been graded. So, the total number of problems is 3 \\* 15 = 45.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of problems left to grade. Since 7 worksheets have already been graded, we can find the number of problems left to grade by subtracting the number of problems on the already graded worksheets from the total number of problems. The number of problems left to grade is 45 - 3 \\* 7 = 45 - 21 = 24.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 24, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/474.png"}
