{"question": "Tom and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop for 8 dollars each. How much did they spend if Tom bought 3 decks and his friend bought 5 decks?", "qid": "230", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the trick decks that Tom and his friend bought.\n\nTom bought 3 decks at $8 each, so the total cost for Tom is 3 decks x $8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.\n\nHis friend bought 5 decks at $8 each, so the total cost for his friend is 5 decks x $8 = $<<5*8=40>>40.\n\nThe total cost of both Tom and his friend is the sum of their individual costs, which is $24 + $40 = $<<24+40=64>>64.\n\nThe answer is $64.", "answer": 64, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/230.png"}
