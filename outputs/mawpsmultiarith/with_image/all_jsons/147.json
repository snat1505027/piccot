{"question": "A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 37 of the old ones and put 7 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?", "qid": "147", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of oranges that were left in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and the new ones were added.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of old oranges that were thrown away. We can do this by subtracting the number of new oranges from the initial number of oranges in the bin.\n\n40 oranges - 7 new oranges = 33 old oranges\n\nNext, we need to find the number of new oranges that were added to the bin. We can do this by adding the number of new oranges to the initial number of oranges in the bin.\n\n40 oranges + 7 new oranges = 47 oranges\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of oranges that were left in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and the new ones were added. We can do this by adding the number of new oranges to the number of old oranges that were thrown away.\n\n33 old oranges + 7 new oranges = 40 oranges\n\nThe answer is 40 oranges.", "answer": 10, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/147.png"}
