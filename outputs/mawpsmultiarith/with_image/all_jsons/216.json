{"question": "Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend?", "qid": "216", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and 5 extra tickets, so she bought a total of 3 + 5 = 8 tickets.\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount spent on the tickets. The price of each ticket is 4 dollars, so the total amount spent on the tickets is 8 tickets x 4 dollars per ticket = <<8*4=32>>32 dollars.\n\nThe answer is 32 dollars.", "answer": 32, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/216.png"}
