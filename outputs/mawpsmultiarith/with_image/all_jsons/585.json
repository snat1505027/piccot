We can do this by subtracting the number of books taken by the librarian from the total number of books.\n\n14 books - 2 books = 12 books\n\nNext, we need to find the number of shelves Roger will need to store the 12 books. We can do this by dividing the number of books by the number of books per shelf.\n\n12 books \u00f7 3 books per shelf = 4 shelves\n\nThe answer is 4 shelves.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/585.png"}
