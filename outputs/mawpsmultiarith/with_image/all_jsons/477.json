{"question": "Tom bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 8 to his little brother. If each box has 3 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Tom still have?", "qid": "477", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of pieces in the 14 boxes. Since each box has 3 pieces, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box:\n\n14 boxes \\* 3 pieces per box = 42 pieces\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of pieces given to the little brother from the total number of pieces:\n\n42 pieces - 8 pieces = 34 pieces\n\nThe answer is 34 pieces.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/477.png"}
