{"question": "April's discount flowers was having a sale where each rose was 9 dollars.

We can do this by multiplying the number of roses by the price per rose.\n\n1. We know that April started with 11 roses.\n2. We know that she had 8 roses left.\n3. We know that the price per rose is 9 dollars.\n\nSo, the total amount of money earned can be calculated as follows:\n\n(11 roses) x (9 dollars per rose) = 99 dollars\n\nSince April had 8 roses left, we can subtract the cost of those roses from the total amount earned:\n\n99 dollars - (8 roses x 9 dollars per rose) = 99 dollars - 72 dollars = 27 dollars\n\nThe answer is 27 dollars.", "answer": 27, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/476.png"}
