{"question": "Edward and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop for 6 dollars each. How much did they spend if Edward bought 3 decks and his friend bought 6 decks?", "qid": "295", "response": "Edward bought 3 decks, and his friend bought 6 decks. The cost of each deck is $6. To find the total amount spent, we need to multiply the number of decks by the cost per deck.\n\n3 decks bought by Edward \\* $6 per deck = $<<3*6=18>>18\n6 decks bought by friend \\* $6 per deck = $<<6*6=36>>36\n\nThe total amount spent is the sum of the amounts spent by both Edward and his friend: $18 + $36 = $<<18+36=54>>54.\n\nThe answer is $54.", "answer": 54, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/295.png"}
