{"question": "Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Kaleb still have?", "qid": "410", "response": "First, we need to find out how many pieces Kaleb's little brother received. We know that Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. Since each box has 6 pieces, we can calculate the number of pieces Kaleb's little brother received by dividing the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box:\n\n5 boxes / 6 pieces per box = 0.8333 pieces per box\n\nSince Kaleb's little brother received 0.8333 pieces per box, we can multiply this by the number of boxes Kaleb bought to find out how many pieces his little brother received:\n\n0.8333 pieces per box \\* 14 boxes = 11.9999 pieces\n\nSince Kaleb's little brother received 11.9999 pieces, we can round this number down to 11 pieces to get a whole number answer.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pieces Kaleb still has. We know that Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother, leaving him with 14 - 5 = 9 boxes. Since each box has 6 pieces, we can calculate the number of pieces Kaleb still has by multiplying the number of boxes he has left by the number of pieces per box:\n\n9 boxes \\* 6 pieces per box = 54 pieces\n\nThe answer is 54 pieces.", "answer": 54, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/410.png"}
