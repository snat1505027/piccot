{"question": "Rachel bought 7 new chairs and 3 new tables for her house. If she spent 4 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes did it take her to finish?", "qid": "272", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total time spent on putting together all the furniture. We can do this by multiplying the number of chairs by the time spent on each chair and the number of tables by the time spent on each table. Then, we add the results to find the total time spent.\n\nThere are 7 chairs, and it took 4 minutes to put together each chair. So, the total time spent on the chairs is 7 chairs x 4 minutes per chair = <<7*4=28>>28 minutes.\n\nThere are 3 tables, and it took 4 minutes to put together each table. So, the total time spent on the tables is 3 tables x 4 minutes per table = <<3*4=12>>12 minutes.\n\nNow, we add the total time spent on the chairs and the tables to find the total time spent on all the furniture: 28 minutes + 12 minutes = <<28+12=40>>40 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 40 minutes.", "answer": 40, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/272.png"}
