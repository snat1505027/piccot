The cost of each necklace is 6 dollars.\n\n3 bead necklaces \\* 6 dollars per necklace = 18 dollars\n3 gem stone necklaces \\* 6 dollars per necklace = 18 dollars\n\nSo, the total cost of the necklaces is 18 dollars + 18 dollars = 36 dollars.\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of the necklaces in terms of the number of necklaces. We know that Isabel sold 3 bead necklaces and 3 gem stone necklaces.\n\n3 bead necklaces \\* 6 dollars per necklace = 18 dollars\n3 gem stone necklaces \\* 6 dollars per necklace = 18 dollars\n\nSo, the total cost of the necklaces in terms of the number of necklaces is 18 dollars + 18 dollars = 36 dollars.\n\nFinally, we can find the total cost of the necklaces in terms of the number of necklaces and the cost per necklace.
