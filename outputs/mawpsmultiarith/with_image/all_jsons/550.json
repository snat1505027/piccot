{"question": "Will had 59 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 32 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?", "qid": "550", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of pieces of clothing in the 9 small loads. We can do this by multiplying the number of pieces in one small load by the number of small loads.\n\n59 pieces of clothing in one load \u00f7 9 small loads = 6.6 pieces of clothing per small load.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a piece of clothing, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n6.6 pieces of clothing per small load rounded up to the nearest whole number = 7 pieces of clothing per small load.\n\nThe answer is 7 pieces of clothing in each of the 9 small loads.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/550.png"}
