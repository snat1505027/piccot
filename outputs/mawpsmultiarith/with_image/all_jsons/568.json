{"question": "Sarah had 55 homework problems. She finished 6 of them but still had 7 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?", "qid": "568", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of problems on each page. Let's start by using the information given in the image.\n\nSarah had 55 homework problems in total. She finished 6 of them, leaving her with 7 pages of problems to do.\n\nWe can represent this information using the following equation:\n\n55 - 6 = 7\n\nNow, we need to find the number of problems on each page. To do this, we can divide the total number of problems by the number of pages left.\n\n55 \u00f7 7 = 7\n\nSince the result is a whole number, we can conclude that there are 7 problems on each page.\n\nThe answer is 7.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/568.png"}
