{"question": "A pet store had 12 siamese cats and 20 house cats. During a sale they sold 20 cats. How many cats do they have left?", "qid": "26", "response": "First, we need to find out how many cats were sold during the sale. We know that 20 cats were sold, so we can write that down as 20 cats sold.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cats were left after the sale. We know that there were 12 siamese cats and 20 house cats initially, and 20 cats were sold. So, we can write that down as 12 siamese cats + 20 house cats - 20 cats sold = <<12+20-20=32>>32 cats left.\n\nThe answer is 32 cats left.", "answer": 12, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/26.png"}
