{"question": "While shopping for music online, Janet bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 9 songs. How many songs did Janet buy total?", "qid": "299", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of songs in the country albums. We know that each country album has 9 songs, so we can multiply the number of country albums by the number of songs per album:\n\n6 country albums \u00d7 9 songs per album = 54 songs in country albums\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of songs in the pop albums. We know that each pop album has 9 songs, so we can multiply the number of pop albums by the number of songs per album:\n\n2 pop albums \u00d7 9 songs per album = 18 songs in pop albums\n\nNow, we can add the total number of songs from both country and pop albums to find the total number of songs Janet bought:\n\n54 songs in country albums + 18 songs in pop albums = 72 songs total\n\nThe answer is 72 songs.", "answer": 72, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/299.png"}
