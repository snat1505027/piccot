{"question": "A pet store had 102 puppies. In one day they sold 21 of them and put the rest into cages with 9 in each cage. How many cages did they use?", "qid": "564", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cages used to hold the remaining puppies. First, we need to find the number of puppies left after selling 21 of them. We can do this by subtracting 21 from 102.\n\n102 - 21 = 81\n\nNext, we need to find the number of puppies in each cage. We know that there are 9 puppies in each cage.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of cages used by dividing the number of puppies left by the number of puppies in each cage.\n\n81 \u00f7 9 = 9\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/564.png"}
