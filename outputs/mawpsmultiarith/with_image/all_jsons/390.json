How many shelves did they use?", "qid": "390", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of giant stuffed bears in the store after the shipment. We can do this by adding the number of bears from the shipment to the number of bears already in stock.\n\n17 (already in stock) + 10 (new shipment) = 27 (total number of bears)\n\nNext, we need to find the number of shelves used. We can do this by dividing the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf.\n\n27 (total number of bears) \u00f7 9 (number of bears per shelf) = 3 (number of shelves used)\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/390.png"}
