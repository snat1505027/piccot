{"question": "A pet store had 88 puppies. In one day they sold 34 of them and put the rest into cages with 6 in each cage. How many cages did they use?", "qid": "593", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cages used to hold the remaining puppies. First, we need to find the number of puppies left after selling 34 of them. We can do this by subtracting 34 from 88.\n\n88 - 34 = 54\n\nNext, we need to find the number of puppies that can fit in each cage. We know that there are 6 puppies in each cage.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of puppies in the cages by multiplying the number of cages by the number of puppies per cage.\n\nTotal number of puppies in cages = Number of cages x Number of puppies per cage\n\nTo find the number of cages, we can divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage.\n\nNumber of cages = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies per cage\n\nTotal number of puppies in cages = 54 puppies\nNumber of puppies per cage = 6 puppies\n\nNumber of cages = 54 puppies / 6 puppies per cage\n\nThe answer is 9 cages.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/593.png"}
