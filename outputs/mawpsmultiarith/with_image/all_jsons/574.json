{"question": "A pet store had 13 puppies. In one day they sold 7 of them and put the rest into cages with 2 in each cage. How many cages did they use?", "qid": "574", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cages used. First, we need to find the number of puppies left in the cages. Since there are 13 puppies and 7 were sold, there are 13 - 7 = <<13-7=6>>6 puppies left.\nNext, we need to find the number of cages that can hold 2 puppies each. To do this, we can divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage. 6 puppies / 2 puppies per cage = <<6/2=3>>3 cages.\nTherefore, the pet store used 3 cages.\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/574.png"}
