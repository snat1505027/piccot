{"question": "Victor was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 7 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 23 trays from one table and 5 trays from another, how many trips will he make?", "qid": "394", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many trips Victor will make to pick up all the trays.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many trips he will make to pick up the trays from the first table. We know that he can carry 7 trays at a time, and there are 23 trays in total. We can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry at a time to find out the number of trips:\n\n23 trays \u00f7 7 trays per trip = 3 trips\n\nNext, we need to find out how many trips he will make to pick up the trays from the second table. We know that there are 5 trays in total, and he can carry 7 trays at a time. Since there are only 5 trays, he can pick them up in one trip.\n\nSo, the total number of trips Victor will make is 3 trips + 1 trip = 4 trips.\n\nThe answer is 4 trips.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/394.png"}
