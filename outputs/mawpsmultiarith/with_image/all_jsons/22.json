We can do this by adding the number of games he bought from his friend and the number of games he bought at the garage sale.\n\n21 games bought from friend + 8 games bought at garage sale = 29 games\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games.\n\n29 games - 23 games that didn't work = 6 games\n\nThe answer is 6 games.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/22.png"}
