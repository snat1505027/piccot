{"question": "The cafeteria had 62 apples. For lunch they handed out 8 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 9 apples, how many pies could they make?", "qid": "508", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples are left after giving 8 apples to students. We can do this by subtracting 8 from 62.\n\n62 - 8 = 54\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pies can be made using the remaining apples. Each pie requires 9 apples, so we can divide the number of apples by 9.\n\n54 \u00f7 9 = 6\n\nThe answer is 6.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/508.png"}
