{"question": "There were 7 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 7 lives, how many lives did they have total?", "qid": "206", "response": "First, we need to find the number of lives each player had before the two new players joined. Since there were 7 friends playing the game, we can assume that each player had 7 lives.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of lives each player had after the two new players joined. Since there were 2 more players, we can add 2 to the number of lives each player had before.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of lives for all players. To do this, we need to multiply the number of lives each player had after the two new players joined by the total number of players.\n\nThe answer is 7 \\* 9 = <<7*9=63>>63.", "answer": 63, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/206.png"}
