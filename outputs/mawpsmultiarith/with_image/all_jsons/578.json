{"question": "Sarah was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Sarah have?", "qid": "578", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of small gardens Sarah had. We know that she planted 12 seeds in the big garden and 3 seeds in each of her small gardens. We can represent this information using the equation:\n\n12 (seeds in big garden) + 3 (seeds in each small garden) = Total seeds\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of seeds Sarah had. We can do this by adding the number of seeds in the big garden and the number of seeds in each small garden:\n\n12 + 3 = 15\n\nNow, we can use the equation to find the number of small gardens:\n\n15 (total seeds) = 12 (seeds in big garden) + 3 (seeds in each small garden)\n\nTo solve for the number of small gardens, we can subtract the number of seeds in the big garden from the total seeds:\n\n15 - 12 = 3\n\nThe answer is 3.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/578.png"}
