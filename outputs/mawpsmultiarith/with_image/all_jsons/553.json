{"question": "There are 17 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 5 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 3 groups, how many students would be in each group?", "qid": "553", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in each group. First, we need to find the total number of students who were not picked for the team. Since there are 17 students trying out and 5 of them didn't get picked, the total number of students in the non-selected group is 17 - 5 = 12.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of students in the three groups. Since there are 12 students in the non-selected group and the rest of the students were put into three groups, the total number of students in the three groups is 12 + 12 + 12 = 36.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of students in each group. To do this, we divide the total number of students in the three groups by the number of groups, which is 3. 36 \u00f7 3 = 12.\n\nThe answer is 12 students in each group.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/553.png"}
