We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. Total number of players: 11\n2. Number of players who quit: 5\n3. Number of lives each player had: 5\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of lives the players had before they quit. We can do this by multiplying the number of players by the number of lives each player had:\n\n11 players \\* 5 lives/player = 55 lives\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of lives the remaining players have. We can do this by subtracting the number of lives the players who quit had from the total number of lives:\n\n55 lives - 5 lives = 50 lives\n\nSo, the remaining players have a total of 50 lives.\n\nThe answer is 50.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/403.png"}
