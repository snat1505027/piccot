We can do this by subtracting the number of coloring books sold (39) from the initial number of coloring books in stock (120).\n\n120 - 39 = 81\n\nSince there are 9 coloring books on each shelf, we can find the number of shelves used by dividing the number of coloring books left (81) by the number of books per shelf (9).\n\n81 \u00f7 9 = 9\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/546.png"}
