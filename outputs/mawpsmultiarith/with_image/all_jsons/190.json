We can do this by subtracting the number of socks thrown away from the initial number of socks.\n\n11 socks - 4 socks = 7 socks\n\nNext, we need to add the number of new socks Oliver bought to find the total number of socks he has now.\n\n7 socks + 26 socks = 33 socks\n\nThe answer is 33 socks.", "answer": 33, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/190.png"}
