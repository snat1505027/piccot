{"question": "A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?", "qid": "450", "response": "To find the time needed to install the rest of the windows, we need to calculate the number of hours needed for the remaining 6 windows.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of windows that will be installed. The total number of windows is 14, and the builder has already installed 8 of them. So, the total number of windows to be installed is 14 - 8 = 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the time needed to install each window. The time needed to install each window is 8 hours.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total time needed to install the remaining 6 windows:\n\n6 windows x 8 hours per window = 48 hours\n\nThe answer is 48 hours.", "answer": 48, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/450.png"}
