{"question": "Katie baked 18 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 8 of them how many packages could she make if she put 2 cupcake in each package?", "qid": "504", "response": "First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Katie has left after Todd ate 8 of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Katie baked.\n\n18 cupcakes - 8 cupcakes = <<18-8=10>>10 cupcakes left\n\nNext, we need to find out how many packages Katie can make if she puts 2 cupcakes in each package. To do this, we can divide the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes per package.\n\n10 cupcakes / 2 cupcakes per package = <<10/2=5>>5 packages\n\nThe answer is 5 packages.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/504.png"}
