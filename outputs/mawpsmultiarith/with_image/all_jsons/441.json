{"question": "A magician was selling magic card decks for 5 dollars each. If he started with 14 decks and by the end of the day he had 5 left, how much money did he earn?", "qid": "441", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money the magician earned by selling the magic card decks. We can do this by multiplying the number of decks he started with by the price per deck.\n\n14 decks \\* $5 per deck = $<<14*5=70>>70\n\nSince the magician started with 14 decks and ended up with 5 decks, we can find the difference between the two by subtracting 5 from 14.\n\n14 decks - 5 decks = 9 decks\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of money the magician earned by multiplying the number of decks he sold by the price per deck.\n\n9 decks \\* $5 per deck = $<<9*5=45>>45\n\nThe magician earned $70 in total, but he only sold 9 decks, so the amount of money he earned from selling the decks is $45.\n\nThe answer is $45.", "answer": 45, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/441.png"}
