{"question": "Luke was selling his old games. He started out with 39 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 4 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?", "qid": "572", "response": "First, we need to find out the number of games Luke had left after selling 19 of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of games sold from the initial number of games:\n\n39 - 19 = 20\n\nNext, we need to find out how many games Luke packed into each box. We know that he packed 4 games into each box.\n\nNow, we need to find out the total number of games Luke had left after packing them into boxes. We can do this by multiplying the number of games per box by the number of boxes:\n\n20 games / 4 games per box = 5 boxes\n\nThe answer is 5 boxes.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/572.png"}
