If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn?", "qid": "322", "response": "To find the total points earned, we need to find the number of points earned by Gwen and her friends separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Gwen recycled 5 pounds of paper. For every 3 pounds, she earned one point. So, Gwen earned 5/3 = 1.67 points.\n2. Her friends recycled 13 pounds of paper. For every 3 pounds, they earned one point. So, her friends earned 13/3 = 4.33 points.\n\nNow, we add the points earned by Gwen and her friends to find the total points earned: 1.67 + 4.33 = 5.99 points.\n\nThe answer is 5.99 points.", "answer": 6, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/322.png"}
