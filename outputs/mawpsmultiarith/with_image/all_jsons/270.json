{"question": "April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 8 dollars. If Vanessa bought 3 roses and 3 daisies, how much did she spend?", "qid": "270", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount spent by Vanessa. We know that each rose costs 8 dollars, and she bought 3 roses. We also know that she bought 3 daisies, but we don't know their price.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total cost of the roses. We multiply the number of roses (3) by their price (8 dollars): 3 x 8 = 24 dollars.\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of the daisies. We don't know their price, so we cannot calculate their cost.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies to find the total amount spent by Vanessa. We add 24 dollars (cost of roses) and the cost of the daisies (which we don't know): 24 + X = Total amount spent.\n\nThe answer is 24 + X.", "answer": 48, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/270.png"}
