{"question": "Oliver was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 2 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?", "qid": "365", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pages Oliver would use to put the 2 new cards and 10 old cards in the binder.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many cards can fit on a page. Since the image shows that 3 cards can fit on each page, we can conclude that 10 cards can fit on 3 pages.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pages Oliver would use to put the 2 new cards and 10 old cards in the binder. To do this, we can use the following equation:\n\n(Number of new cards) + (Number of old cards) = (Number of pages used)\n\nIn this case, 2 new cards + 10 old cards = 12 cards. Since we know that 10 cards can fit on 3 pages, we can conclude that 12 cards can fit on 4 pages.\n\nTherefore, Oliver would use 4 pages to put the 2 new cards and 10 old cards in the binder.\n\nThe answer is 4 pages.", "answer": 4, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/365.png"}
