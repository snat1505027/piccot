{"question": "Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?", "qid": "5", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of carrots picked by Carol and her mom. We can do this by adding the number of carrots picked by each person: 29 + 16 = 45.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of good carrots. We know that 38 of the carrots were good, so we can find the total by multiplying the number of good carrots by the total number of carrots: 38 x 45 = 1680.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of bad carrots. We can do this by subtracting the total number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked: 45 - 1680 = -1635.\n\nThe answer is -1635.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/5.png"}
