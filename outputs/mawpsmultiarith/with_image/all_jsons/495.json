{"question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. If a group of 9 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?", "qid": "495", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost for the group to eat. We know that each adult meal costs $2, and there are 9 adults in the group. So, the total cost for the adults to eat would be 9 x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18.\n\nSince there are 2 kids in the group, they do not contribute to the cost of the meal. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be $18.\n\nThe answer is $18.", "answer": 14, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/495.png"}
