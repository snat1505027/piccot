{"question": "At the fair there were 31 people in line for the bumper cars. If 25 of them got tired of waiting and left and 25 more got in line, how many people would be in line?", "qid": "184", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people in the line after 25 people left and 25 more got in line.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of people who got tired of waiting and left. We can do this by subtracting the number of people who got tired of waiting from the initial number of people in line.\n\n31 people in line - 25 people who got tired of waiting = 5 people who didn't get tired of waiting\n\nNext, we need to find the number of people who got in line after the 25 people who got tired of waiting left. We can do this by adding the number of people who got tired of waiting to the number of people who didn't get tired of waiting.\n\n5 people who didn't get tired of waiting + 25 people who got tired of waiting = 30 people who got in line\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of people in the line after 25 people got in line. We can do this by adding the number of people who got in line to the number of people who didn't get tired of waiting.\n\n30 people who got in line + 5 people who didn't get tired of waiting = 35 people in line\n\nThe answer is 35.", "answer": 31, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/184.png"}
