{"question": "A store had 34 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 20 of the old ones and put 13 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?", "qid": "113", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of oranges that were left in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and the new ones were added.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of oranges that were thrown away. We can do this by subtracting the number of new oranges from the initial number of oranges in the bin.\n\n34 oranges - 13 new oranges = 21 old oranges\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of oranges in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and the new ones were added.\n\n34 oranges + 13 new oranges = 47 oranges\n\nThe answer is 47 oranges.", "answer": 27, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/113.png"}
