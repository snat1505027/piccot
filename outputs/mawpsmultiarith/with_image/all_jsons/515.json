{"question": "There are 65 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 17 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 8 groups, how many students would be in each group?", "qid": "515", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in each group. First, we need to find the total number of students who didn't get picked for the team. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who got picked from the total number of students trying out.\n\n65 students trying out - 17 students who didn't get picked = 48 students who got picked\n\nNow, we need to divide the total number of students who didn't get picked by the number of groups to find the number of students in each group.\n\n48 students who didn't get picked / 8 groups = 6 students in each group\n\nThe answer is 6 students in each group.", "answer": 6, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/515.png"}
