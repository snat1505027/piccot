{"question": "Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 42 seeds and planted 36 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 2 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?", "qid": "552", "response": "To find the number of small gardens, we need to find the number of seeds Emily planted in the big garden and the number of seeds she planted in each small garden.\n\nIn the big garden, Emily planted 36 seeds.\n\nIn each small garden, she planted 2 seeds.\n\nTo find the total number of seeds Emily planted, we need to add the number of seeds planted in the big garden and the number of seeds planted in each small garden.\n\nThe total number of seeds Emily planted is 36 + 2 \\* 4 = 36 + 8 = 44.\n\nSince Emily started with 42 seeds, the number of seeds she planted in her small gardens is 42 - 44 = -2.\n\nThis is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem statement. The answer cannot be negative.\n\nThe answer is 42.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/552.png"}
