{"question": "Nancy and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47. If only 71 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?", "qid": "75", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of carrots picked by Nancy and her mother. We can do this by adding the number of carrots picked by each person.\n\nNancy picked 38 carrots, and her mother picked 47 carrots. So, the total number of carrots picked is 38 + 47 = 85.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of bad carrots. We know that only 71 of the carrots were good. So, the number of bad carrots is 85 - 71 = 14.\n\nThe answer is 14 bad carrots.", "answer": 14, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/75.png"}
