{"question": "Chloe baked 7 brownies, but needed 16 total for her party. If she used 6 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?", "qid": "496", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cups of flour Chloe still needs. We know that she baked 7 brownies, but needed 16 total for her party. We also know that she used 6 cups of flour on each one.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many cups of flour she used in total. To do this, we multiply the number of brownies she baked by the amount of flour she used per brownie: 7 brownies \\* 6 cups of flour per brownie = <<7*6=42>>42 cups of flour used.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cups of flour she still needs. To do this, we subtract the amount of flour she used from the total amount of flour needed for the party: 16 total brownies \\* 6 cups of flour per brownie = <<16*6=96>>96 cups of flour needed. 42 cups of flour used - 96 cups of flour needed = <<42-96=-54>>-54 cups of flour still needed.\n\nHowever, this answer is incorrect because it is negative. We need to find out what Chloe still needs in a positive amount. To do this, we can add the amount of flour she used to the total amount of flour needed for the party: 42 cups of flour used + 96 cups of flour needed = <<42+96=138>>138 cups of flour still needed.\n\nThe answer is 138 cups of flour still needed.", "answer": 54, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/496.png"}
