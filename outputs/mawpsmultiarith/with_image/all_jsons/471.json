{"question": "A trivia team had 11 members total, but during a game 6 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 9 points, how many points were scored total?", "qid": "471", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total points scored by the trivia team members who did show up. We can do this by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of members who showed up. Since there were 11 members in total and 6 members didn't show up, we can find the number of members who showed up by subtracting the number of members who didn't show up from the total number of members:\n\n11 members - 6 members = 5 members\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total points scored by the members who showed up. We can do this by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored:\n\n5 members \\* 9 points = 45 points\n\nThe answer is 45 points.", "answer": 45, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/471.png"}
