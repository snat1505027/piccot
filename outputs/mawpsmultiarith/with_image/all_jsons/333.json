{"question": "For Halloween Sarah received 66 pieces of candy from neighbors and 15 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 9 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?", "qid": "333", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days the candy will last Sarah. We can do this by dividing the total number of candies she received (66) by the number of candies she eats per day (9).\n\n66 \u00f7 9 = 7.3333...\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a day, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n7 \u2248 7 days\n\nThe answer is 7 days.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/333.png"}
