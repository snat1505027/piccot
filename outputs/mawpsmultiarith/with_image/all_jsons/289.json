{"question": "Tom was putting his spare change into piles. He had 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes. If each pile had 5 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?", "qid": "289", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of coins in the piles. We know that there are 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes. Each pile of quarters has 5 coins, and each pile of dimes has 5 coins.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of quarters. There are 2 piles of quarters, and each pile has 5 coins. So, the total number of quarters is 2 x 5 = 10.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of dimes. There are 4 piles of dimes, and each pile has 5 coins. So, the total number of dimes is 4 x 5 = 20.\n\nNow, we can add the total number of quarters and dimes to find the total number of coins. The total number of coins is 10 + 20 = 30.\n\nThe answer is 30.", "answer": 30, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/289.png"}
