{"question": "Adam earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn?", "qid": "416", "response": "First, we need to find the number of lawns Adam actually mowed. Since he forgot to mow 8 lawns, he mowed 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 lawns.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of lawns Adam earned money for. Since he earned 9 dollars for each lawn, he earned 9 \\* 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 dollars for the 4 lawns he mowed.\n\nFinally, we need to find the total amount of money Adam earned. He earned 36 dollars for the 4 lawns he mowed, so he earned 36 + the money he earned for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow. However, we don't know how much he earned for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow, so we cannot determine the total amount of money Adam earned.\n\nThe answer is $36.", "answer": 36, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/416.png"}
