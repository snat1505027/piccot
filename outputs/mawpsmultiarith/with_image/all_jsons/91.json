{"question": "A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 26 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 27 customers. If 27 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?", "qid": "91", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of customers the waiter had to wait on. We can do this by adding the initial number of customers (26) and the additional customers (27).\n\n26 + 27 = 53\n\nNext, we need to find the number of customers who didn't leave a tip. The image shows that 27 customers didn't leave a tip.\n\nNow, we can find the number of customers who did leave a tip by subtracting the number of customers without a tip from the total number of customers.\n\n53 - 27 = 26\n\nThe answer is 26.", "answer": 26, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/91.png"}
