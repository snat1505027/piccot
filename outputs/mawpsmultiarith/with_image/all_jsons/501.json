{"question": "A pet store had 18 puppies. In one day they sold 3 of them and put the rest into cages with 5 in each cage. How many cages did they use?", "qid": "501", "response": "First, we need to find out how many puppies were left after selling 3 of them. We can do this by subtracting 3 from 18.\n\n18 - 3 = 15\n\nNext, we need to find out how many puppies can fit in each cage. We can do this by dividing the number of puppies left by 5.\n\n15 \u00f7 5 = 3\n\nSince we have 15 puppies left and we can fit 3 puppies in each cage, we need to find out how many cages we need to use. We can do this by multiplying the number of puppies left by the number of puppies per cage.\n\n15 \u00d7 3 = 45\n\nThe answer is 45.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/501.png"}
