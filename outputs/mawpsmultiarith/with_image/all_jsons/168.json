{"question": "A store had 50 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 40 of the old ones and put 24 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?", "qid": "168", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of oranges that were left in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and the new ones were added.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of old oranges that were thrown away. We can do this by subtracting the number of new oranges from the initial number of oranges in the bin.\n\n50 oranges - 24 new oranges = 26 old oranges thrown away\n\nNext, we need to add the number of new oranges to the number of old oranges thrown away to find the final number of oranges in the bin.\n\n26 old oranges thrown away + 24 new oranges = 50 oranges in the bin\n\nThe answer is 50.", "answer": 34, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/168.png"}
