{"question": "Lana's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 6 dollars each. Lana bought 8 tickets for herself and her friends and 2 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend?", "qid": "254", "response": "To find the total amount spent by Lana, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets she bought and the cost of the extra tickets.\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the 8 tickets Lana bought for herself and her friends:\n8 tickets x $6 per ticket = $<<8*6=48>>48\n2. Calculate the cost of the 2 extra tickets:\n2 tickets x $6 per ticket = $<<2*6=12>>12\n3. Add the cost of the 8 tickets and the cost of the 2 extra tickets to find the total amount spent by Lana:\n$48 + $12 = $<<48+12=60>>60\n\nThe answer is $60.", "answer": 60, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/254.png"}
