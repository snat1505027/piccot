{"question": "Paul made 3 dollars mowing lawns and 3 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?", "qid": "366", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how long the money will last Paul if he spends $3 per week. We can do this by dividing the amount of money he has by the amount he spends per week.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total amount of money Paul has. He made $3 from mowing lawns and $3 from weed eating, so he has a total of $3 + $3 = $6.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of weeks the money will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of money by the amount he spends per week: $6 \u00f7 $3 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the money will last Paul for 2 weeks.\n\nThe answer is 2 weeks.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/366.png"}
