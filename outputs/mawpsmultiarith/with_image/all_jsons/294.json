{"question": "Kaleb was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 4 bags up and on Sunday he filled 6 more bags. If each bag had 4 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total?", "qid": "294", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cans collected by Kaleb.\n\nOn Saturday, he filled 4 bags with 4 cans each, so the total number of cans collected on Saturday is 4 bags x 4 cans per bag = 16 cans.\n\nOn Sunday, he filled 6 more bags with 4 cans each, so the total number of cans collected on Sunday is 6 bags x 4 cans per bag = 24 cans.\n\nTo find the total number of cans collected, we need to add the number of cans collected on Saturday and Sunday: 16 cans + 24 cans = 40 cans.\n\nThe answer is 40 cans.", "answer": 40, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/294.png"}
