{"question": "A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have?", "qid": "571", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tables the waiter had. Let's start by finding the number of tables with 4 people at each table.\n\n14 customers left, and the rest of the tables had 4 people at each table. So, the total number of tables with 4 people at each table is:\n\n14 customers left / 4 people per table = <<14/4=3.5>>3.5 tables\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a table, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of tables. So, the total number of tables with 4 people at each table is 4 tables.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of tables the waiter had. Since 14 customers left, and the waiter had 22 customers in his section initially, the total number of tables the waiter had is:\n\n22 customers - 14 customers who left = <<22-14=8>>8 tables\n\nThe answer is 8 tables.", "answer": 2, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/571.png"}
