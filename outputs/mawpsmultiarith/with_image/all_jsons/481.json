{"question": "Tom bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Tom still have?", "qid": "481", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of pieces in the 12 boxes. Since each box has 6 pieces, we can multiply 12 by 6 to get the total number of pieces:\n\n12 boxes x 6 pieces per box = 72 pieces\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of pieces Tom gave to his little brother from the total number of pieces. Since Tom gave 7 pieces to his little brother, we can subtract 7 from 72 to get the number of pieces Tom still has:\n\n72 pieces - 7 pieces = 65 pieces\n\nThe answer is 65 pieces.", "answer": 30, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/481.png"}
