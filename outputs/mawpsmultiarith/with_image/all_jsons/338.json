{"question": "While playing at the arcade, Edward won 3 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 5 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he was trying to buy candy that cost 4 tickets a piece, how many could he buy?", "qid": "338", "response": "First, we need to find out how many tickets Edward has in total. He won 3 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 5 tickets playing 'skee ball', so he has a total of 3 + 5 = 8 tickets.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pieces of candy he can buy with his tickets. The candy costs 4 tickets per piece, so we can divide the total number of tickets by the number of tickets per piece to find out how many pieces of candy he can buy. 8 tickets \u00f7 4 tickets per piece = 2 pieces of candy.\n\nThe answer is 2 pieces of candy.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/338.png"}
