{"question": "Kaleb was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 5 bags up and on Sunday he filled 5 more bags. If each bag had 4 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total?", "qid": "275", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cans collected by Kaleb.\n\nOn Saturday, he filled 5 bags with 4 cans in each bag, so the total number of cans collected on Saturday is 5 bags x 4 cans per bag = 20 cans.\n\nOn Sunday, he filled 5 more bags with 4 cans in each bag, so the total number of cans collected on Sunday is 5 bags x 4 cans per bag = 20 cans.\n\nThe total number of cans collected is the sum of the cans collected on Saturday and Sunday, which is 20 cans + 20 cans = 40 cans.\n\nThe answer is 40 cans.", "answer": 40, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/275.png"}
