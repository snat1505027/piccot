{"question": "Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Ned still have?", "qid": "402", "response": "First, we need to find out how many pieces Ned's little brother received. We know that Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. We can find the number of pieces by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of pieces in each box:\n\n14 boxes \\* 6 pieces per box = 84 pieces\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of pieces given to the little brother from the total number of pieces:\n\n84 pieces - 7 pieces = 77 pieces\n\nThe answer is 77 pieces.", "answer": 42, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/402.png"}
