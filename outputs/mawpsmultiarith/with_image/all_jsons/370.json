{"question": "For a birthday party Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 6 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?", "qid": "370", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many shelves Cody would need to fill up with regular sodas and diet sodas.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many regular sodas Cody bought. There are 4 regular sodas in total.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many diet sodas Cody bought. There are 44 diet sodas in total.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many sodas can fit on each shelf. Since the fridge can hold 6 sodas on each shelf, we can calculate the total number of sodas that can fit on the shelves by adding the number of regular sodas and diet sodas.\n\n4 regular sodas + 44 diet sodas = 48 sodas in total\n\nSince the fridge can hold 6 sodas on each shelf, we can calculate the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of sodas by the number of sodas per shelf.\n\n48 sodas / 6 sodas per shelf = 8 shelves\n\nThe answer is 8 shelves.", "answer": 8, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/370.png"}
