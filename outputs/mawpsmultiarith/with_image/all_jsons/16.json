{"question": "Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 11 games from a friend and bought 22 more at a garage sale.

We can do this by adding the number of games he bought from his friend and the number of games he bought at the garage sale.\n\n11 games bought from friend + 22 games bought at garage sale = 33 games\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games.\n\n33 games - 19 games that didn't work = 14 games\n\nThe answer is 14 games.", "answer": 14, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/16.png"}
