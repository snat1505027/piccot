{"question": "Emily had 7 coloring books. If she gave away 2 of them, but then bought 14 more, how many would she have total?", "qid": "154", "response": "First, we need to find the number of coloring books Emily has after giving away 2 of them. We can do this by subtracting 2 from 7:\n\n7 - 2 = 5\n\nNext, we need to find the number of coloring books Emily has after buying 14 more. We can do this by adding 14 to the number of coloring books she already has:\n\n5 + 14 = 19\n\nFinally, we need to find Emily's total number of coloring books by adding the number of coloring books she has after giving away 2 and the number of coloring books she has after buying 14 more:\n\n5 + 19 = 24\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 19, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/154.png"}
