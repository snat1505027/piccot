We know that she baked 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies, and after the sale, she had 24 pastries left to take back home.\n\nLet's start by finding out how many cupcakes and cookies Wendy sold. We can do this by subtracting the number of pastries she has left from the total number of pastries she baked.\n\n4 cupcakes + 29 cookies = <<4+29=33>>33 pastries\n\n33 pastries - 24 pastries = <<33-24=9>>9 pastries sold\n\nThe answer is 9 pastries.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/11.png"}
