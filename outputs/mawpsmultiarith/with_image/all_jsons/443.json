{"question": "A painter needed to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 3 hours to paint. If he already painted 4 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?", "qid": "443", "response": "The painter has already painted 4 rooms, which means he has painted 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 rooms.\nEach room takes 3 hours to paint, so the total time spent on painting the 8 rooms is 8 \\* 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 hours.\nThe painter needs to paint 4 more rooms, which means he has to paint a total of 12 rooms.\nSince he has already painted 8 rooms, he needs to paint 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4 more rooms.\nThe time it takes to paint 4 more rooms is 4 \\* 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 hours.\nThe total time it will take the painter to paint all 12 rooms is 24 + 12 = <<24+12=36>>36 hours.\nThe answer is 36.", "answer": 24, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/443.png"}
