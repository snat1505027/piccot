{"question": "For Halloween Robin scored 23 pieces of candy. She ate 7 pieces the first night and then her sister gave her 21 more pieces. How many pieces of candy does Robin have now?", "qid": "138", "response": "First, we need to find out how many pieces of candy Robin had after the first night. We know that she ate 7 pieces, so we need to subtract those from her initial score of 23.\n\n23 - 7 = 16\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pieces of candy Robin received from her sister. We know that she received 21 pieces.\n\nNow, we need to add the number of pieces Robin received from her sister to the number of pieces she had left after the first night.\n\n16 + 21 = 37\n\nThe answer is 37.", "answer": 37, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/138.png"}
