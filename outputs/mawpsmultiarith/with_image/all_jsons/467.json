{"question": "A new building needed 12 windows. The builder had already installed 6 of them. If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?", "qid": "467", "response": "The builder has already installed 6 windows, which means he has installed 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 windows.\nIt takes 4 hours to install each window, so the total time to install all 12 windows would be 12 windows x 4 hours per window = <<12*4=48>>48 hours.\nSince the builder has already installed 6 windows, he has 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 windows left to install.\nThe time it will take him to install the rest of the windows is 6 windows x 4 hours per window = <<6*4=24>>24 hours.\nThe answer is 48 hours - 24 hours = <<48-24=24>>24 hours.", "answer": 24, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/467.png"}
