{"question": "Billy was putting his spare change into piles. He had 2 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. If each pile had 4 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?", "qid": "277", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of coins in the piles. We know that there are 2 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. Each pile of quarters has 4 coins, and each pile of dimes has 4 coins.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of quarters. There are 2 piles of quarters, and each pile has 4 coins. So, the total number of quarters is 2 \\* 4 = <<2*4=8>>8.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of dimes. There are 3 piles of dimes, and each pile has 4 coins. So, the total number of dimes is 3 \\* 4 = <<3*4=12>>12.\n\nNow, we can add the total number of quarters and dimes to find the total number of coins. The total number of coins is 8 + 12 = <<8+12=20>>20.\n\nThe answer is 20.", "answer": 20, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/277.png"}
