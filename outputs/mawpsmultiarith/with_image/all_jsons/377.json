{"question": "A pet shelter had 3 puppies when another 3 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?", "qid": "377", "response": "First, we need to find the number of puppies in the shelter after the 3 new puppies were brought in. We can do this by adding the number of puppies before and after the new puppies were brought in.\n\n3 puppies before + 3 puppies after = 6 puppies in the shelter\n\nNext, we need to find the number of days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted. We can do this by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.\n\n6 puppies / 3 puppies per day = 2 days\n\nThe answer is 2 days.", "answer": 2, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/377.png"}
