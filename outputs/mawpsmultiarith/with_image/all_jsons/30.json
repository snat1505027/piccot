{"question": "A pet store had 38 siamese cats and 25 house cats. During a sale they sold 45 cats. How many cats do they have left?", "qid": "30", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cats left at the pet store after the sale.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of cats that were sold during the sale. We can do this by adding the number of siamese cats and house cats that were sold:\n\n38 siamese cats + 25 house cats = 63 cats sold\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the initial number of cats at the store:\n\n38 siamese cats + 25 house cats - 63 cats sold = 30 cats left\n\nThe answer is 30 cats left at the pet store after the sale.", "answer": 18, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/30.png"}
