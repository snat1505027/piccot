{"question": "At the town carnival Oliver rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. If each ride cost 3 tickets, how many tickets did he use?", "qid": "292", "response": "To find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we need to multiply the number of times he rode each ride by the number of tickets each ride cost.\n\nFor the ferris wheel, he rode it 7 times, and each ride cost 3 tickets. So, the total number of tickets for the ferris wheel is 7 x 3 = 21 tickets.\n\nFor the bumper cars, he rode them 3 times, and each ride cost 3 tickets. So, the total number of tickets for the bumper cars is 3 x 3 = 9 tickets.\n\nTo find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we need to add the total number of tickets for both rides: 21 + 9 = 30 tickets.\n\nThe answer is 30 tickets.", "answer": 30, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/292.png"}
