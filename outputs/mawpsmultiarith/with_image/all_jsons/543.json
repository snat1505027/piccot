{"question": "There are 25 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 15 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 2 groups, how many students would be in each group?", "qid": "543", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in each group. First, we need to find the total number of students in the two groups. We can do this by adding the number of students who didn't get picked for the team and the number of students in each group.\n\n15 students didn't get picked for the team, so we add that number to the total.\n\n25 students trying out for the team + 15 students not picked = 40 students in total\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups to find the number of students in each group.\n\n40 students in total \u00f7 2 groups = 20 students in each group\n\nThe answer is 20 students in each group.", "answer": 5, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/543.png"}
