{"question": "Sarah's old washing machine could only wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 43 shirts and 2 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?", "qid": "376", "response": "First, we need to determine the total number of items that need to be washed. There are 43 shirts and 2 sweaters, so the total number of items is 43 + 2 = 45.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of items that can be washed in each load. Since the washing machine can only wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time, we need to divide the total number of items by 5 to find out how many loads are needed.\n\n45 items \u00f7 5 items per load = 9 loads needed.\n\nThe answer is 9.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/376.png"}
