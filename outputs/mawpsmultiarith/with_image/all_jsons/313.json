{"question": "A pet shelter had 9 puppies when another 12 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?", "qid": "313", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of puppies in the shelter. We can do this by adding the number of puppies brought in and the number of puppies already in the shelter.\n\n9 + 12 = 21\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of puppies that will be adopted per day. We can do this by multiplying the number of puppies adopted per day by the total number of puppies in the shelter.\n\n3 puppies/day \\* 21 puppies = 63 puppies\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted. We can do this by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.\n\n21 puppies / 63 puppies/day = 33.33 days\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of days.\n\n33.33 days \u2248 34 days\n\nThe answer is 34 days.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/313.png"}
