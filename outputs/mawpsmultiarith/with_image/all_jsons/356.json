{"question": "Haley and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?", "qid": "356", "response": "To find the total points earned, we need to find the number of points earned by Haley and her friends separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Haley recycled 11 pounds of paper. For every 3 pounds, she earned one point. So, she earned 11/3 = <<11/3=3.7>>3.7 points.\n2. Her friends recycled 16 pounds of paper. For every 3 pounds, they earned one point. So, they earned 16/3 = <<16/3=5.33>>5.33 points.\n\nNow, we add the points earned by Haley and her friends to find the total points earned: 3.7 + 5.33 = <<3.7+5.33=9.03>>9.03 points.\n\nThe answer is 9.03 points.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/356.png"}
