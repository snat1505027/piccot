{"question": "For a birthday party Jerry bought 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 9 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?", "qid": "306", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many shelves Jerry would need to fill up with regular sodas and diet sodas.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many regular sodas can fit on each shelf. We know that there are 41 regular sodas in total, and we can divide that by the number of sodas per shelf (9) to find out how many shelves are needed for regular sodas:\n\n41 regular sodas \u00f7 9 sodas per shelf = 4.61 shelves\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of shelves. Therefore, Jerry would need 5 shelves filled up with regular sodas.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many diet sodas can fit on each shelf. We know that there are 22 diet sodas in total, and we can divide that by the number of sodas per shelf (9) to find out how many shelves are needed for diet sodas:\n\n22 diet sodas \u00f7 9 sodas per shelf = 2.44 shelves\n\nAgain, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of shelves. Therefore, Jerry would need 3 shelves filled up with diet sodas.\n\nIn summary, Jerry would need a total of 8 shelves filled up with sodas, with 5 shelves filled up with regular sodas and 3 shelves filled up with diet sodas.\n\nThe answer is 8.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/306.png"}
