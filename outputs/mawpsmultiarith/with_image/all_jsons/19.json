{"question": "Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?", "qid": "19", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of carrots picked by both Bianca and her mother. We can do this by adding the number of carrots picked by each person: 26 + 15 = 41.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of good carrots. We know that 16 of the carrots were good, so we can find the total number of good carrots by dividing the total number of carrots by 16 and then multiplying by 16: 41 \u00f7 16 \u00d7 16 = 16.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of bad carrots. We can do this by subtracting the total number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked: 41 - 16 = 25.\n\nThe answer is 25.", "answer": 25, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/19.png"}
