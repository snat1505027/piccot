{"question": "Edward earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 17 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 9 of them, how much money did he actually earn?", "qid": "479", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of lawns Edward mowed. We know that he mowed 17 lawns, but he forgot to mow 9 of them. So, the total number of lawns mowed is 17 - 9 = 8 lawns.\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount of money Edward earned for mowing the lawns. We know that he earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed. So, the total amount of money he earned is 8 lawns \\* 4 dollars/lawn = 32 dollars.\n\nFinally, we need to find the money earned for the forgotten lawns. We know that he forgot to mow 9 lawns, so the money earned for those lawns is 9 lawns \\* 4 dollars/lawn = 36 dollars.\n\nThe answer is 32 dollars + 36 dollars = 68 dollars.", "answer": 32, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/479.png"}
