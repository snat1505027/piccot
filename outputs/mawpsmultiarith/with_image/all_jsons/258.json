{"question": "Megan was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 7 bead necklaces and 3 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 9 dollars, how much money did she earn?", "qid": "258", "response": "To find the total number of necklaces sold, we need to add the number of bead necklaces and gem stone necklaces.\n\n7 bead necklaces + 3 gem stone necklaces = 10 necklaces\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of the necklaces sold. We can do this by multiplying the number of necklaces by the cost per necklace.\n\n10 necklaces \u00d7 $9 per necklace = $90\n\nFinally, we can find Megan's earnings by subtracting the total cost of the necklaces from the total amount of money she earned.\n\nMegan's earnings = Total money earned - Total cost of necklaces\n\nThe answer is $90 - $90 = $0.", "answer": 90, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/258.png"}
