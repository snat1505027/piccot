{"question": "Megan had 40 homework problems. She finished 26 of them but still had 2 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?", "qid": "525", "response": "Megan had 40 homework problems in total. She finished 26 of them, leaving her with 2 pages of problems to do. Let's assume that each page has the same number of problems.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of problems on the first page. We can do this by dividing the total number of problems by the number of pages:\n\n40 / 2 = 20\n\nSince each page has the same number of problems, we can conclude that there are 20 problems on the first page.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of problems on the second page. We can do this by subtracting the number of problems on the first page from the total number of problems:\n\n40 - 20 = 20\n\nSince each page has the same number of problems, we can conclude that there are 20 problems on the second page as well.\n\nThe answer is 20.", "answer": 7, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/525.png"}
