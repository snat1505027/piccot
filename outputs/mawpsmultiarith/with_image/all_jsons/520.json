{"question": "There are 36 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 9 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 3 groups, how many students would be in each group?", "qid": "520", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in each group. First, we need to find the total number of students who were not picked for the team. We can do this by subtracting the number of students picked for the team from the total number of students trying out.\n\n36 students trying out - 9 students picked for the team = 27 students not picked for the team\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of students not picked for the team by the number of groups formed. In this case, there are 3 groups.\n\n27 students not picked for the team \u00f7 3 groups = 9 students per group\n\nThe answer is 9 students per group.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/520.png"}
