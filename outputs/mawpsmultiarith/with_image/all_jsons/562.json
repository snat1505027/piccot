{"question": "A company invited 45 people to a luncheon, but 35 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 2 people each, how many tables do they need?", "qid": "562", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tables needed for the remaining 10 people.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of tables needed for the 35 people who didn't show up. Since each table can hold 2 people, we can divide the number of people by the number of people per table:\n\n35 people / 2 people per table = 17.5 tables\n\n2. Since we can't have a fraction of a table, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of tables. In this case, we need 18 tables for the 35 people who didn't show up.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the number of tables needed for the remaining 10 people. We can do this by dividing the number of people by the number of people per table:\n\n10 people / 2 people per table = 5 tables\n\n4. Since we already have 18 tables for the 35 people who didn't show up, we only need to add 5 more tables to accommodate the remaining 10 people.\n\n5. The answer is 18 + 5 = 23 tables needed.\n\nThe answer is 23 tables.", "answer": 5, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/562.png"}
