{"question": "A new building needed 10 windows. The builder had already installed 6 of them. If it takes 5 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?", "qid": "415", "response": "The builder has already installed 6 windows, which means he has installed 6/10 of the total number of windows needed. To find out how many windows are left to install, we can subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed:\n\n10 - 6 = 4\n\nSince it takes 5 hours to install each window, we can find out how many hours it will take to install the remaining 4 windows by dividing the total number of hours by the number of windows left to install:\n\n5 / 4 = 1.25\n\nThe answer is 1.25 hours.", "answer": 20, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/415.png"}
