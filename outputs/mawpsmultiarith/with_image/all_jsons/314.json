{"question": "Roger was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another, how many trips will he make?", "qid": "314", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many trips Roger will make to pick up all the trays.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many trips Roger will make to pick up the trays from the first table. Since he can carry 4 trays at a time, we can divide the number of trays by 4.\n\n10 trays \u00f7 4 = 2.5 trips\n\nSince Roger can only make whole trips, he will make 2 trips to pick up the trays from the first table.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many trips Roger will make to pick up the trays from the second table. Since he can carry 2 trays at a time, we can divide the number of trays by 2.\n\n2 trays \u00f7 2 = 1 trip\n\nSince Roger has already made 2 trips to pick up the trays from the first table, he will make 1 more trip to pick up the trays from the second table.\n\nIn total, Roger will make 2 + 1 = 3 trips to pick up all the trays.\n\nThe answer is 3 trips.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/314.png"}
