{"question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?", "qid": "462", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost for the group to eat. We know that each adult meal costs $5, and there are 7 adults in the group. So, the total cost for the adults is 7 x $5 = $<<7*5=35>>35.\n\nWe also know that 8 kids are in the group, and they eat for free. So, the total cost for the group to eat is the cost for the adults plus the cost for the kids. Since the kids eat for free, the total cost for the group to eat is $35.\n\nThe answer is $35.", "answer": 35, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/462.png"}
