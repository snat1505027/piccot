{"question": "There were 13 friends playing a video game online when 8 players quit. If each player left had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total?", "qid": "488", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of lives the remaining players have. We can do this by using the number of players who quit and the number of lives each player had.\n\n1. We know that 8 players quit, so the remaining players are 13 - 8 = 5.\n2. Each player who quit had 6 lives, so the total number of lives they had is 8 \\* 6 = 48.\n3. Now, we need to find the total number of lives the remaining players have. Since there are 5 players left, we can multiply the number of lives each player had by the number of remaining players: 5 \\* 6 = 30.\n4. To find the total number of lives, we add the number of lives the remaining players have to the total number of lives the players who quit had: 48 + 30 = 78.\n\nThe answer is 78.", "answer": 30, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/488.png"}
