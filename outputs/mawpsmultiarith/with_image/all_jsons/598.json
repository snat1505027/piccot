{"question": "Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 14 of them how many packages could she make if she put 8 cupcake in each package?", "qid": "598", "response": "First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Sarah has left after Todd ate 14 of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Sarah baked.\n\n38 cupcakes - 14 cupcakes = 24 cupcakes left\n\nNext, we need to find out how many packages of 8 cupcakes each Sarah can make. To do this, we can divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package.\n\n24 cupcakes \u00f7 8 cupcakes per package = 3 packages\n\nThe answer is 3 packages of 8 cupcakes each.", "answer": 3, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/598.png"}
