{"question": "Wendy earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 11 bags, but didn't recycle 2 of them, how many points would she have earned?", "qid": "408", "response": "First, we need to find the number of points Wendy would have earned if she had recycled all 11 bags. We can do this by multiplying the number of bags by the number of points earned per bag.\n\n11 bags \\* 5 points per bag = 55 points\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of points Wendy would have earned if she had recycled 2 fewer bags. Since she didn't recycle 2 bags, she would have earned 2 fewer points.\n\n55 points - 2 points = 53 points\n\nThe answer is 53 points.", "answer": 45, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/408.png"}
