{"question": "Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables for her house. If she spent 6 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes did it take her to finish?", "qid": "223", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Wendy spent on putting together all the furniture pieces.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of chairs and tables. There are 4 chairs and 4 tables.\n\nNext, we need to find the total time spent on each piece of furniture. Since the image shows that Wendy spent 6 minutes on each piece of furniture, we can multiply the total number of chairs and tables by 6 to find the total time spent.\n\nTotal time spent on chairs = 4 chairs x 6 minutes per chair = 24 minutes\nTotal time spent on tables = 4 tables x 6 minutes per table = 24 minutes\n\nNow, we can add the total time spent on chairs and tables to find the total time Wendy spent on putting together all the furniture pieces.\n\nTotal time spent = 24 minutes + 24 minutes = 48 minutes\n\nThe answer is 48 minutes.", "answer": 48, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/223.png"}
