{"question": "A pet shelter had 8 puppies when another 19 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?", "qid": "360", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the 19 new puppies were brought in. We can do this by adding the initial 8 puppies to the 19 new puppies.\n\n8 + 19 = 27\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted if 3 puppies are adopted per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.\n\n27 / 3 = 9\n\nThe answer is 9 days.", "answer": 9, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/360.png"}
