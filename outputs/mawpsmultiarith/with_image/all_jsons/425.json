{"question": "Mike invited 13 friends to a birthday party, but 7 couldn't come. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 4, how many should he buy?", "qid": "425", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cupcakes Mike should buy. First, we need to find the number of cupcakes for the 13 friends who could come. We can do this by multiplying the number of friends by the number of cupcakes per person: 13 friends x 4 cupcakes per person = 52 cupcakes.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of cupcakes for the 7 friends who couldn't come. We can do this by multiplying the number of friends by the number of cupcakes per person: 7 friends x 4 cupcakes per person = 28 cupcakes.\n\nNow, we need to add the total number of cupcakes for both groups of friends to find the total number of cupcakes Mike should buy: 52 cupcakes + 28 cupcakes = 80 cupcakes.\n\nThe answer is 80 cupcakes.", "answer": 24, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/425.png"}
