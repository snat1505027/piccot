{"question": "A store had 31 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 9 of the old ones and put 38 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?", "qid": "133", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of oranges in the bin after the old ones were thrown away and new ones were added.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of oranges that were thrown away. We know that 9 old oranges were thrown away, so we can subtract 9 from the initial number of oranges in the bin, which was 31.\n\n31 - 9 = 22\n\nNext, we need to add the number of new oranges that were put in the bin. We know that 38 new oranges were added, so we can add 38 to the total number of oranges in the bin.\n\n22 + 38 = 60\n\nThe answer is 60.", "answer": 60, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/133.png"}
