{"question": "In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 9 points. If a level has 11 enemies total and you destroy all but 3 of them, how many points would you earn?", "qid": "413", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of points earned by defeating the remaining 3 enemies. We can do this by using the information provided in the image.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of points earned for each enemy defeated. The image shows that 9 points are awarded for each enemy defeated.\n2. Next, we need to find the total number of points earned for defeating all 11 enemies. To do this, we multiply the number of enemies by the number of points earned per enemy: 11 enemies x 9 points/enemy = 99 points.\n3. Since we have defeated all but 3 enemies, we need to subtract the number of enemies defeated from the total number of enemies: 11 enemies - 3 enemies = 8 enemies.\n4. Now, we can find the number of points earned for defeating the remaining 3 enemies. We multiply the number of enemies by the number of points earned per enemy: 3 enemies x 9 points/enemy = 27 points.\n5. Finally, we add the number of points earned for defeating all 8 enemies to the number of points earned for defeating the remaining 3 enemies: 99 points + 27 points = 126 points.\n\nThe answer is 126 points.", "answer": 72, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/413.png"}
