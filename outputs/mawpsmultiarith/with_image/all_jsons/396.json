{"question": "Katie uploaded 30 pictures from her phone and 51 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 9 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?", "qid": "396", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pictures in each album. We know that Katie uploaded a total of 30 + 51 = 81 pictures. We also know that she sorted the pictures into 9 different albums.\n\nLet's start by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums: 81 / 9 = 9.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. This remainder will tell us how many pictures are left over after we have distributed the pictures evenly among the albums.\n\n81 % 9 = 0\n\nThis means that there are no pictures left over, and we have successfully distributed the pictures evenly among the 9 albums.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9 pictures in each album.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/396.png"}
