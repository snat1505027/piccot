{"question": "Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 of them, how many points would she have earned?", "qid": "499", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of points Megan earned for the bags she recycled. We know that she earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of bags Megan recycled. We know that she had 14 bags, but 5 of them were not recycled. So, she recycled 14 - 5 = 9 bags.\n\n2. Next, we need to multiply the number of bags she recycled by the number of points she earned per bag. 9 bags \\* 8 points/bag = 72 points.\n\n3. Finally, we need to subtract the number of points she would have earned if she had recycled all 14 bags. If she had recycled all 14 bags, she would have earned 14 \\* 8 = 112 points. So, we need to subtract 112 from 72 to find the actual number of points she earned. 72 - 112 = -39.\n\nThe answer is -39.", "answer": 72, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/499.png"}
