{"question": "Bianca picked 23 carrots from her garden. If she threw out 10 of them and then picked 47 more the next day, how many carrots would she have total?", "qid": "170", "response": "First, we need to find the number of carrots Bianca has after throwing out 10 of them. We can do this by subtracting 10 from the number of carrots she picked: 23 - 10 = 13.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of carrots she has after picking 47 more. We can do this by adding 47 to the number of carrots she already has: 13 + 47 = 60.\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of carrots. We can do this by adding the number of carrots she had before picking more and the number of carrots she picked after: 60 + 47 = 107.\n\nThe answer is 107.", "answer": 60, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/170.png"}
