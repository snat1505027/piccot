{"question": "Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 4 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, how many points did they earn?", "qid": "307", "response": "To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Paige and her friends separately.\n\nPaige recycled 14 pounds of paper, which is 14/4 = <<14/4=3.5>>3.5 pounds more than the required 4 pounds for one point. Therefore, Paige earned 3.5/4 = <<3.5/4=0.875>>0.875 points.\n\nHer friends recycled 2 pounds of paper, which is 2/4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 pounds less than the required 4 pounds for one point. Therefore, her friends earned 0.5/4 = <<0.5/4=0.125>>0.125 points.\n\nThe total points earned by Paige and her friends are 0.875 + 0.125 = <<0.875+0.125=0.99995>>0.99995 points.\n\nThe answer is 0.99995 points.", "answer": 4, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/307.png"}
