{"question": "A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?", "qid": "357", "response": "First, we need to find out how many puppies are left to be adopted. We can do this by subtracting the number of puppies adopted each day from the total number of puppies.\n\n17 + 55 = 72 puppies in the shelter\n8 puppies a day are adopted\n\n72 - 8 = 64 puppies left to be adopted\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted. We can do this by dividing the number of puppies left to be adopted by the number of puppies adopted each day.\n\n64 / 8 = 8 days\n\nThe answer is 8 days.", "answer": 9, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/357.png"}
