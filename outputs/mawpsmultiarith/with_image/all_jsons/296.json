{"question": "Emily bought 4 new chairs and 2 new tables for her house. If she spent 8 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes did it take her to finish?", "qid": "296", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total time spent on furniture assembly. We can do this by adding the time spent on each piece of furniture.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of chairs and tables. There are 4 chairs and 2 tables, so the total number of pieces of furniture is 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the time spent on each piece of furniture. The time spent on each piece of furniture is 8 minutes, so the total time spent on each piece of furniture is 8 minutes.\n\nFinally, we can add the time spent on each piece of furniture to find the total time spent on furniture assembly. The total time spent on furniture assembly is 8 minutes per piece of furniture \\* 6 pieces of furniture = 48 minutes.\n\nThe answer is 48 minutes.", "answer": 48, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/296.png"}
