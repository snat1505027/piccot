{"question": "April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. If Robin bought 5 roses and 4 daisies, how much did she spend?", "qid": "249", "response": "First, we need to find the total cost of the roses. There are 5 roses, and each rose costs 3 dollars. So, the total cost of the roses is 5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of the daisies. There are 4 daisies, and each daisy costs 2 dollars. So, the total cost of the daisies is 4 x 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.\n\nFinally, we need to find the total cost of both the roses and the daisies. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the roses and the cost of the daisies, which is $15 + $8 = $<<15+8=23>>23.\n\nThe answer is $23.", "answer": 27, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/249.png"}
