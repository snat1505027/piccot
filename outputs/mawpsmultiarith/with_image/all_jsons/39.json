{"question": "Edward was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 41 games from a friend and bought 14 more at a garage sale. If 31 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?", "qid": "39", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of games bought at the garage sale. We can do this by adding the number of games bought from the friend and the number of games bought at the garage sale.\n\n41 (games bought from friend) + 14 (games bought at garage sale) = 55 (total games bought)\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games bought.\n\n55 (total games bought) - 31 (games that didn't work) = 24 (good games)\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 24, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/39.png"}
