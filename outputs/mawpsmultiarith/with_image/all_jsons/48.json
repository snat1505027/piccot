{"question": "Vanessa and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Vanessa picked 17 and her mother picked 14. If only 24 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?", "qid": "48", "response": "First, we need to find the total number of carrots picked by both Vanessa and her mother. We can do this by adding the number of carrots picked by each person: 17 + 14 = 31.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of good carrots. We know that 24 of the carrots were good, so we can subtract the number of bad carrots from the total number of carrots: 31 - 24 = 7.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of bad carrots by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots: 31 - 7 = 24.\n\nThe answer is 24.", "answer": 7, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/48.png"}
