{"question": "Each chocolate bar in a box cost $6. If a box had 13 bars total and Zoe sold all but 6 bars, how much money would she have made?", "qid": "423", "response": "To find the total cost of the 13 chocolate bars, we need to multiply the number of bars by the cost per bar.\n\n13 bars \\* $6/bar = $<<13*6=78>>78\n\nSince Zoe sold 6 bars, we need to subtract the cost of the 6 bars from the total cost.\n\n78 - 6 = $<<78-6=72>>72\n\nThe answer is $72.", "answer": 42, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/423.png"}
