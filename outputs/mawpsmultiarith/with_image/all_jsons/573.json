{"question": "Haley baked 20 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 11 of them how many packages could she make if she put 3 cupcake in each package?", "qid": "573", "response": "First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Haley has left after Todd ate 11 of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of cupcakes Todd ate from the total number of cupcakes Haley baked.\n\n20 cupcakes - 11 cupcakes = <<20-11=9>>9 cupcakes left\n\nNext, we need to find out how many packages Haley can make if she puts 3 cupcakes in each package. We can do this by dividing the number of cupcakes left by the number of cupcakes per package.\n\n9 cupcakes \u00f7 3 cupcakes per package = <<9/3=3>>3 packages\n\nThe answer is 3 packages.", "answer": 3, "correct": false, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/573.png"}
