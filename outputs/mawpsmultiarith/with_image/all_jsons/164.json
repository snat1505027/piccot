{"question": "Bianca had 34 songs on her mp3 player.

We can do this by adding 44 to the number of songs after deleting 14 old songs:\n\n20 + 44 = 64\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of songs on her mp3 player now. We can do this by adding the number of songs after deleting 14 old songs and adding 44 new songs:\n\n64 + 20 = 84\n\nThe answer is 84.", "answer": 64, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/164.png"}
