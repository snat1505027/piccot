We know that he had 10 tickets initially and 3 tickets left, so he used 7 tickets. We also know that each ticket cost 9 dollars.\n\nTo find out how much money Adam spent on the ferris wheel, we need to multiply the number of tickets used by the cost per ticket:\n\n7 tickets used \\* 9 dollars per ticket = <<7*9=63>>63 dollars spent\n\nThe answer is $63.", "answer": 63, "correct": true, "image": "images/mawpsmultiarith/490.png"}
